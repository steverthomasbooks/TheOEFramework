          <h2>Introduction</h2>
        </header>
        <div class="content">
          <p>
            Starting as early as kindergarten, we are taught that a solid
            education, a college degree, and a white-collar, high-paying
            corporate job are the keys to wealth and happiness in America. We
            are taught that after graduating, getting a job is as simple as
            walking into a business, asking for the manager, shaking hands with
            a strong grip, looking them right in the eyes with confidence, and
            telling them, “I want a job.” We have been taught that hard work
            pays off and that will alone can get us there.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span><br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Nothing could be further from the truth. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span><br /><span class="span-tab"></span>The
            real truth is that corporate America has been optimized to such
            extremes that it has completely lost sight of the goals, purpose,
            and, most importantly, the human element behind hiring and keeping
            qualified candidates. Computer analysis weeds out any candidates who
            had the misfortune of not using the perfect set of keywords in their
            resumes. Online job postings lead to hundreds, if not thousands, of
            applicants for every role. HR software suites make the hiring
            process involve as little human contact as possible. Corporations
            have optimized all aspects of the hiring flow to save every penny
            they can, making it nearly impossible to find a meaningful job
            unless you know the system. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span><br /><span class="span-tab"></span>The issues don’t stop there.
            Once you actually have a job in the corporate world, things only get
            worse. Many corporations still operate under outdated and
            inefficient processes, whether by choice or ignorance. People are
            expected to work forty or more hours a week but are only given a few
            hours of meaningful tasks. The efficiency gains of the digital age
            are wasted on busy work and tasks that have no real value.
            Higher-ups continuously make sweeping decisions that ruin thousands
            of lives to save a couple of ticks on the stock price. Head-counts
            and over-hiring are practiced across the board to meet budget and
            accounting metrics—or worse, to have expendable capital when the
            company’s stocks need a little pick-me-up. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span><br /><span class="span-tab"></span>This is the
            day-to-day environment that Americans are now facing. We battle
            against droves of candidates for low-paying positions in an uncaring
            and dystopian work environment. The structure of companies in
            today’s America is vastly different than it was only a handful of
            years ago. The obsession with cost and process optimization has left
            many of us working for companies that treat their employees the same
            way they treat their customers—as faceless numbers and accounts to
            squeeze money out of. Companies simply do not care about the very
            people who create them. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span><br /><span class="span-tab"></span>The unforeseen result of all
            this is a disillusioned, unmotivated, and uninvested workforce.
            There is a crisis of purpose for American workers. There is a reason
            the current generation is not interested in following what the older
            generations have been doing for decades. The reward no longer
            matches the cost. The cause is not what the media might tag as
            ‘quiet quitting’ or some equally silly marketing phrase. Given the
            right circumstances, almost everyone at their core has the drive to
            perform their best and deliver work they are proud of. When workers
            are paid fairly and given autonomy, purpose, and the opportunity to
            master their craft, they are increasingly more productive and
            produce better results. However, today's work environment is
            practically designed to prevent workers from doing their best.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span><br /><span class="span-tab"></span>The final result? White-collar workers who barely manage
            to zombie through eight-hour days while delivering about three hours
            of actual work. Workers who “pretend” to work for hours—or days—at a
            time while endlessly scrolling through social media. Workers who
            hate their jobs. Workers who spend their whole lives dreaming of
            escape. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span><br /><span class="span-tab"></span>There is, however, another alternative. One that
            uses corporate America’s greed against itself—an alternative that
            makes the current landscape of optimization, abuse, and overzealous
            cost savings an ally. With the worldwide shift to remote work, more
            and more people have started taking control of their own lives,
            careers, and financial freedom by pursuing a previously unimaginable
            work style: abusing the system, automating their jobs, and, for
            some, holding multiple white-collar jobs at the same time. People
            are doubling, tripling, or even quadrupling their income thanks to
            "overemployment"—the term being used to describe the lifestyle of
            multiple full-time job juggling. Because when you understand how
            corporate America works, and how it does not work, you can use it to
            your advantage. You can find the holes and turn them into loopholes.
            Corporate inefficiency, greed, and waste can be tools that make your
            life easier. Like a computer hacker, you can learn to find, and
            ultimately exploit, the cracks in the system—and exploiting these
            cracks can lead to unimaginable gains. Using corporate greed against
            itself can ultimately free you from the corporate cycle and help you
            find financial freedom. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span><br /><span class="span-tab"></span>That is the purpose of this
            book: to pull back the curtain and expose the illusions of corporate
            America. To show you the cracks and teach you the tricks you can
            utilize to break free.

            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span><br /><span class="span-tab"></span>——

            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span><br /><span class="span-tab"></span>My journey down this path started slowly, but it barely
            took a year of working in corporate America to realize how flawed
            the system is. To even get an entry-level position, I had to learn a
            multitude of tricks and cheats for landing corporate jobs. I spent
            countless hours learning resume hacks and interview tactics—and
            countless more applying to every opportunity I could find. Once I
            had my foot in the door, I found myself facing a cost-obsessed,
            political, anti-worker corporate world filled with policies and
            practices specifically aimed against employees. Nothing made this
            more clear than my first annual review, where I was reprimanded for
            giving myself high scores on my self-assessment, regardless of the
            praise I had received all year for my work. I would later learn that
            self-assessments are specifically designed to use psychology to keep
            raises as low as possible, relying on modesty and people being their
            “own worst critic” to keep review scores and the following raises as
            low as possible. It was the first of many lessons I would learn over
            the next few years. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span><br /><span class="span-tab"></span>As my career progressed, I found
            that I had a knack for climbing the corporate ladder, office
            politics, and moving up quickly—but with every growth opportunity
            and step forward, I was continuously shocked by how dystopian our
            corporate lives have become. Even more shockingly, I discovered how
            much of it was driven by automated systems. When I was first given
            access to a company's HR tools to help manage a team, I fully came
            to understand that corporations are not our allies, and they
            certainly treat their own workers as their enemies. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span><br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Over
            the next several years, I experienced an awakening to the corporate
            circus. I was dedicated and passionate about my career and field,
            but the environment that drives today’s workforce does not encourage
            passion nor dedication. My view began to shift, and I started to
            realize that escaping corporate America is the real American dream.
            I began to understand that in today’s market, hard work is punished.
            There is no longer any sense of company loyalty. Instead, I found
            that reflecting a corporation's behavior was the best way to get
            ahead and ultimately escape the escapade. I learned that, in the
            right circumstances, you should lie, cheat, and abuse the
            system—reflecting the same behavior as the corporations that hire
            you. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span><br /><span class="span-tab"></span>By the time I was five years into my career, I had
            changed jobs over six times, solely in pursuit of driving my pay to
            be in the top five percent in my industry. I began to follow an
            organized methodology for making the most money possible while doing
            the least amount of work possible, freeing myself to pursue my
            actual passions. I let go of all the societal norms around the job
            market and all loyalty and politeness for the companies I was
            working for. At the time of writing this book, I have had well over
            fifteen jobs. Some I used as simple stepping stones to improve my
            pay or minimize workloads, while others I kept for years after
            automating most of my day-to-day work. I have made well over half a
            million dollars in extra income by optimizing my salary, workflows,
            and workloads.

            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span><br /><span class="span-tab"></span>——

            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span><br /><span class="span-tab"></span>This book is my hard-learned guide to beating and
            escaping the corporate system. Whether your goal is financial
            freedom, semi-retirement, or simply reducing your work hours in your
            current role, you will find plenty of recommendations and tricks to
            help get you there. Like any book of the genre, there are chapters
            that will be useful to some readers more than others. The first half
            is designed for those trying to break into corporate America. It
            serves as a general guide for choosing and landing the most
            exploitable jobs. The second half focuses primarily on outsourcing,
            optimizing, and automating as much of your day-to-day as
            possible—and claiming back your life from the nine-to-five race. For
            the sake of helping you optimize your workflows, each chapter
            includes a brief summary of key points; a “Too Long; Didn’t Read''
            bullet list of the main ideas. While I encourage skipping items that
            are not applicable to you, most chapters contain straightforward,
            real actions that can be taken to improve your corporate life in a
            myriad of ways. Some might be more insightful than they seem at
            first glance. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span><br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            I hope you find this book helpful and actionable, but most
            importantly, I hope it helps you find your way to escaping the
            current landscape of corporate America. We are all capable of great
            things when given the time and freedom to pursue our passions. I
            hope this book acts as a first step in helping you find that
            greatness.

          <p>
            Corporate America runs the show. They’re the big boss behind the
            curtain, calling the shots and dictating our lives—whether we
            realize it or not. The average American’s life is catered,
            scheduled, and tethered to the eight-hour day—the forty-hour
            workweek. The nine-to-five life is standard, and we have all
            accepted it as the “norm.” As if it’s what we as humans have done
            forever.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>In truth, it is not a universal concept. As of 2020, the
            average worker in Germany, Denmark, the UK, and Norway works
            twenty-six hours per week after factoring in vacations. In the US,
            it’s thirty-four hours per week. That is eight hours more—an entire
            workday we lose each week<sup>1</sup>. How is it that we’ve accepted
            that we must be at our desks, whether at home or in person, from
            nine-to-five, five days a week, even when there is no work to be
            done?
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>The Legend (and Lies) of the Forty-Hour Workweek
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>The forty-hour workweek is a relatively new concept. In fact,
            it’s just a century old. Before modern technology, humans only
            worked as much as they needed in order to survive. Anthropologists
            believe this number was far less than forty hours—most likely about
            twenty-four hours each week. The largest shift to our expected work
            hours happened at the start of the Industrial Revolution.
            Seventy-hour workweeks peaked in the early 1800s, sparking the labor
            movement. Exhausted workers fought to cut down their hours to a
            ten-hour workday. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Everything changed in 1926, thanks to Henry
            Ford of the Ford Motor Company. Ford created the five-day,
            forty-hour workweek we follow today. This was a model designed for
            his assembly line workers. Ford adopted eight-hour workdays so he
            could keep his factories running twenty-four/seven, cycling workers
            through three different shifts. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Soon enough, this model
            inspired the U.S. government. At the time, Americans were desperate
            to control unemployment levels and labor strikes during the Great
            Depression. Leaders saw an opportunity here: With shorter hours,
            more people would be required to work, increasing employment and
            reducing hours. About a decade later, the Fair Labor Standards Act
            of 1938 was signed, enacting minimum wage and overtime for anyone
            working over forty hours per week<sup>2</sup>. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>This was back
            in the early 1900s—an era without home computers, smartphones, or
            ChatGPT. An era where forty hours were necessary to get a laborious
            job done. Yet nearly a century ago, renowned economist, John Maynard
            Keynes, believed the workweek would continually get shorter, thanks
            to the advancement of technology. He believed that technology would
            improve so much that we would be able to get all of our work done in
            a fifteen-hour workweek by 2030, that modern technology would make
            us more productive and as a result, we’d work less. Many critics
            laugh about how far off his estimate was. What they don’t realize,
            though, is how accurate the concept actually is<sup>3</sup>.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Fast forward nearly a hundred years later, and we are still
            blindly following the forty-hour system, even when we can get the
            same tasks done in minutes or seconds. Research shows the average
            white-collar worker is only productive for two hours and fifty-three
            minutes daily, or just under fifteen hours a week. Keynes was right
            about that. Somehow, we still find ourselves working for an average
            of 8.8 hours every day<sup>4</sup>. What’s happening outside of
            these three hours of productivity? <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Workers habitually fill in
            this time by reading news sites, checking social media, chatting
            with coworkers, taking breaks, making calls, mindlessly scrolling,
            or even pretending to work. What if we cut out these five unfocused
            hours? What if we prioritized the three hours of work and nothing
            else? What if we just stopped pretending? <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Simple math would
            tell us that if you are earning a yearly salary for eight hours of
            work a day, cutting your time down to three hours a day, or about
            fifteen hours a week, would nearly triple your hourly pay. You would
            be raking in more than two and a half times your hourly rate for the
            same amount of work. You’re simply working quicker and smarter, not
            harder. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Now, what do you do with all your extra free time? You
            have two options: <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>You can keep your one job and earn the same
            salary while spending your extra time your way: vacationing, picking
            up hobbies, spending time with your family, you name it. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Or
            you can get your fast pass to getting rich and retiring early by
            stacking another job for a self-driven-dual-income. You will earn
            the salary for two jobs while keeping your hours at forty or less.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>And that’s exactly what we’re here to learn how to do. It
            begins with understanding the difference between “time jobs” and
            “value jobs.”
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Time Jobs
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>There are two types of jobs: Time jobs and value jobs. Time
            jobs are any role that requires you to trade your time for money.
            Millions of jobs fall into this category, jobs that pay you an
            hourly wage or annual salary in exchange for your time. The minimum
            requirement for time jobs is to show up: Clock in, work, clock out,
            and repeat. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>You have to be fully present to perform time jobs.
            These are your retailers, customer support agents, hourly laborers,
            servers, and even lawyers, realtors, and doctors. Time jobs can
            range from minimum wagers to high-tax-bracket big shots. Jobs that
            are dependent on time are not necessarily “low paying” jobs, but
            they do tend to scale in intensity, difficulty, education,
            competition, and time requirements as the pay goes up. Surgeons may
            charge several hundred dollars an hour, but they have to be there to
            perform. In time jobs, you almost always have to spend more time to
            earn more money, whether increasing your hours, responsibilities, or
            education. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>This can significantly affect your time-to-income
            ratio, even when making the big bucks. For example, the average
            lawyer in the U.S. made about $135,000 in 2022. In general, lawyers'
            salaries can range from about $65,000 - $200,000 or more depending
            on an individual’s education, certifications, and experience—or in
            other words, how much time they’ve already put into their
            career<sup>5</sup>. This pay seems great… until it requires sixty,
            seventy, or even eighty hours of work per week. It can vary between
            firms, but many lawyers work anywhere from forty to eighty-hour
            weeks. When you’re on the high end of the spectrum, it feels like
            you’re making more simply because you’re working harder. But
            truthfully? If you earn the average lawyer’s salary and work seventy
            hours at a firm, you make about thirty-seven dollars an hour. For
            comparison, the average U.S. hourly earning is $33.36, as of April
            2023<sup>6</sup>. While you won’t likely make the same grand total
            in other white-collar fields, the hourly rates aren’t that different
            when you’re overworking. Plus, you can’t forget to add the years
            spent in a classroom and thousands in student loans to the equation.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>With this in mind, it only makes sense why most nine-to-fivers
            are unhappy with their jobs. The “Great Resignation” largely
            impacted time jobs for this very reason. Jobs in the transportation,
            healthcare, food, and hospitality industries currently have some of
            the highest numbers of job openings because they treat time as the
            primary value<sup>7</sup>. They count minutes of work, not
            measurements of results. They nickel and dime their employees’ time.
            With recent shifts to the labor market, employees are starting to
            see that they can shift to value jobs where that is not the case.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Too many of today’s workers are stuck in this minute-counting
            cycle; their employer counts minutes while they count down the days
            until they’re sixty-five, retired, and can finally enjoy life (if
            they put enough money in their 401(k)). <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>But that’s not you.
            Otherwise, you wouldn’t be here, right? <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>The first step to
            fast-tracking your exit from corporate America into early retirement
            is shifting from a time job to a value job(s).
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Value Jobs
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Value jobs are any jobs that do not directly require a
            dedicated amount of time to perform. Instead, they pay based on the
            delivery of a task or track of work. It’s not about how many hours
            it took for you to put the project together—it’s about how much
            value it adds to the company. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>We hear the cliche “time is
            money” constantly, but how can you truly put a dollar value on an
            hour of your time? This is especially true when you might spend one
            hour zoned out in meetings and yet another on focused, productive
            work. There comes a point in your career where you can only increase
            your time value so much. Those who scale their incomes and retire
            early aren’t doing it off three percent annual raises or end-of-year
            bonuses. No—they’re not trading their time for money. They’re
            trading their value for money. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>This, right here, is the key:
            If you want to become rich while working in corporate America, you
            need to be in a role that allows you to trade value for money
            instead of time. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>If you want to work multiple jobs or
            semi-retire, you must find value jobs. Remember: Something isn’t
            more valuable just because it took longer to make. It’s valuable
            because it solves a problem. It’s valuable because it helps reach a
            goal, speed up a process, or make someone’s life easier. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>These
            are jobs like design, development, quality assurance, project work,
            data entry, writing, user experience (UI/UX) roles, reporting, data
            management, and creative roles. Look for jobs where you deliver
            projects to provide value. Ones that require your skill but not
            necessarily your complete involvement, attention, and presence from
            nine-to-five. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Value jobs are the only way to make more money
            for your time. And as your skill increases, your pay increases. This
            includes speed. If time is money, working faster should pay more,
            not less. This is exactly what corporate America takes advantage of.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Let’s say you’re a full-time, salaried graphic designer for a
            marketing agency. This is a value job. As you sharpen your skills at
            work, you learn how to create designs faster… but you don’t get paid
            more than your coworkers each day. In fact, you are technically
            being paid less, as you’re getting paid the same amount for doing
            more. The value you’re providing goes up, but your pay doesn’t. If
            you cut out the middleman and sold the designs via contract, your
            income would go up the faster you completed projects. You would be
            rewarded for your increased value and speed, not punished with a
            bigger workload simply because you’re good at your job. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>The
            point here isn’t to quit the corporate world to become a contractor.
            The goal is to take advantage of the flawed system. If you can learn
            to complete your projects in three hours instead of eight, you can
            gain time back in your life, or stack two jobs while still working
            forty hours or less. You can double your income without doubling the
            amount of time you work. And instead of waiting thirty years to
            retire, you can cut your time to retirement down exponentially.

            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Ethics of Juggling Two Jobs
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>This is where “The Morally Flexible Guide” comes into play.
            The “secretly working two full-time remote jobs” is a hot ethics
            debate. I would argue it doesn't have to be that negative. This
            isn’t just “quiet quitting,” where you do the bare minimum and still
            get paid. In value-based roles, you can still perform well and
            provide value to the company while working fewer hours. It doesn’t
            mean you are conning anyone out of their time. It just means doing a
            good job doesn't take as long as it used to. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>In October 2022,
            ResumeBuilder.com surveyed 1,250 full-time U.S. remote workers and
            revealed that sixty-nine percent were working some form of second
            job or side hustle. Most of those working two jobs are using the
            extra income and flexibility to pay off debt and enjoy more spending
            money<sup>8</sup>. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>These are modern professionals who’ve
            realized how much unnecessary time was wasted by being forced to
            work at, and commute to, the office. Even more, these are
            professionals who’ve learned to make the most of their time to earn
            extra income, take control of their schedules, and seek financial
            freedom. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Of course, you might be skeptical, wondering is it
            even legal to hold two jobs? I’m not a lawyer. This book is not a
            replacement for legal advice. This is research you’ll need to do
            yourself to protect your assets. However, as of 2023, no laws
            prevent employees from having more than one job. That isn’t to say
            there can not be potential legal issues if your positions overlap,
            confidential information is used carelessly, or you simply get
            lazy<sup>9</sup>. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>This leads us to our second question: Is it
            ethical? Those who are reluctant about the concept of overemployment
            are often afraid of being caught. They think it is “stealing” from
            their company. Or perhaps they’re so busy with their current job
            that they can’t even imagine working two jobs. The latter are likely
            those working time jobs, where companies treat them as numbers
            instead of valuable assets. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>What’s actually unethical is
            companies demanding you to work forty hours a week when the work
            realistically required of you might only take about fifteen hours.
            What’s actually stealing is companies controlling how you use your
            time, even when you deliver on every responsibility and task
            required of you. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Value jobs create an ethical balance between
            employee and employer: They pay you for a completed task, which you
            deliver. It’s about quality, not quantity. Results, not routines.
            Hanging around doing nothing is “stealing time,” anyway. Juggling
            two jobs requires you to evaluate what tasks provide the most value
            to the company and commit your energy to delivering this value. It
            urges you to prioritize, strategize, and optimize your efforts to
            support the company’s legitimate goals—instead of mindlessly working
            for a few hours and then wasting the rest of the day finding memes
            and reading articles. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>In short? You’re still delivering on
            what was outlined in the job description. When working two
            value-based jobs, you’re still doing what’s required of you, minus
            the fluff. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Again, you don’t have to have two jobs. You can
            find a value job, optimize your time, and cut down your hours so you
            can live life your way in a semi-retired state. You can “clock out”
            at noon, actually take “unlimited” vacation days, and be there for
            your family. But if you want to take advantage of the system
            designed to take advantage of you, welcome to the world of
            overemployment.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Corporate America is Taking Advantage of You
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>From mass layoffs and office politics to overworked and
            underpaid employees, corporate America knows what they’re doing—they
            just don’t care. Overemployment works because many companies are
            over-hiring on purpose. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Layoffs are the final step in the
            corporate cost-cutting cycle. In January 2023, Microsoft announced
            10,000 layoffs. Google’s parent company, Alphabet, planned to cut
            12,000 jobs. Twitter infamously laid off 6,000 employees after Elon
            Musk took over<sup>10</sup>. In total, Amazon, Google, Microsoft,
            and Meta announced plans to lay off 50,000 employees in 2023. Often,
            these mass layoffs are preventable. It all starts with an
            over-hiring problem. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Here’s the thing: In September 2022,
            Amazon more than doubled its corporate staff compared to three years
            prior. Meta also went on a hiring spree, doubling its team between
            March 2020 and September 2022<sup>11</sup>. These aren’t accidents.
            We’re talking about some of the most successful companies, all of
            which have grown larger during the COVID-19 pandemic. Over-hiring
            isn’t an oversight—it’s part of a corporate growth strategy.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>When markets are good, companies act fast to capitalize on the
            high, even though they know it will likely go back down. They go on
            hiring sprees to double down on human resources, getting as many
            hands on deck as possible. Then, when staffing redundancy is
            apparent, the market goes down, or a project fails, they cut back.
            They apply a “hiring and firing” growth strategy, bringing on too
            many professionals quickly to scale the company, then cutting back
            and laying off to reduce costs<sup>12</sup>. The over-hiring problem
            is another reason why many value jobs are easy to juggle: When there
            are too many hands on deck, you don’t need to spend unnecessary time
            babysitting your computer, waiting for something to come your way.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>This leaves us to question: Should we really stay loyal to
            companies that would replace us in a heartbeat if something were to
            happen to us? Is it really unethical to deliver our work, cut out
            the unnecessary time-wasters, and stack two jobs for corporate
            companies? With all the benefits that technology has given us, do we
            really need to pretend that our work still requires forty hours a
            week to deliver? <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Computers, undoubtedly, have changed the way
            we work. Modern technology has made workers significantly more
            efficient than the pace of business. Processes that once took days,
            months, and even years to complete can be checked off in minutes
            with the right technology and skilled user. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>You can take
            advantage of this by finding a value job that is at least partially
            digital. Technology improves our value; the ability to use this
            technology increases our value. Workers have become more efficient
            over time, but corporations have yet to pay them more. With the
            current landscape of software, AI, and other technology, workers are
            producing more than ever. Yet companies haven't taken any of this
            into consideration—and you shouldn't either. This is why:
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Eighteen percent of workers spend less than one hour each day on
            their core job functions. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Eighty-one percent spend less than three hours on creative work.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Ninety percent spend up to five hours checking messages. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Eighty-three percent spend up to three hours picking up their
            coworkers’ slack<sup>13</sup>.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>These numbers show how limited we are by the corporate system.
            If we can drill down to our core processes, we can deliver the value
            we were hired to produce and take back control of our time.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Shifting to a Value Job Mindset
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Value jobs pay you for the results you bring to the market
            rather than the time you spend on the job. These jobs are more
            skill-based, requiring you to utilize your knowledge and expertise
            in a specific industry or field. They can give you more control over
            your work schedule, workload, and overall financial health. You can
            also work independently, flexibly, or remotely and have more control
            over your work-life balance. Many value jobs are extremely easy to
            train for and become proficient in. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>From development and data
            entry to design and marketing roles, you should first find a skill
            that doesn’t require much actual experience to do the work. These
            jobs require a learned skill rather than a rigid education minimum.
            For example, companies will likely hire a social media manager
            because they have the skills to do it, not just because they have a
            degree in marketing. In contrast, you’ll only get hired in a
            nursing, teaching, or engineering role if you have the education to
            certify your qualifications. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>To switch to a value job, you
            must first identify your skills and passions. Think about what you
            enjoy doing, what you are good at, and what you want to learn.
            Identify the industry or field you want to work in and what it takes
            to gain the relevant skills or qualifications. Ideally, you want to
            identify which value-based skills you already have and build on
            them. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Not sure if it’s a value-based skill or job? Here’s a
            simple rule of thumb: If you can offer the service as a freelancer,
            it’s likely a value job. Look for jobs that can be done or practiced
            outside of a formal work environment. Some of the most in-demand
            value skills are creative roles, web design, copywriting, graphic
            design, social media marketing, data analytics, video production,
            and app development<sup>14</sup>. Focus on areas that either:
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Don’t require extensive education or experience; or <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>

            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>From here, invest in value-based skill development. There are
            a multitude of resources that can train you to become proficient
            enough to handle these jobs, many of which we’ll break down in
            Chapter 2.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Getting Started: It’s Easier Than You Think
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Too many people are scared to enter corporate America, but
            they shouldn’t be. Everyone learns on the job. The average
            white-collar worker is shockingly unprepared and unqualified for
            their role. Most corporations just plan on hiring personalities and
            trainable candidates. The majority of professionals aren't that good
            at their jobs, especially at first, so you don't have to be either.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Research shows that fifty-nine percent of employees in today’s
            workplace have no workplace training<sup>15</sup>. They are all
            pretty much self-taught. Forty-two percent of job applicants don’t
            even meet the skills requirements of the job posting<sup>16</sup>.
            The distribution curve for job skills and performance shows that
            only a small percentage of workers are above the 'Average'
            performance rating. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>But that’s okay. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>It's no wonder many
            companies would rather focus on hiring individuals they believe they
            can shape during the onboarding process. Eighty-four percent of
            companies are willing to hire candidates that don’t have the
            required skills. They’re looking for people they think they can
            train well on the job. “Culture fit” ends up being more important
            than anything. Fortunately for you, this means there’s room to
            improve your skills and learn everything you need to know on the
            job. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Gallup research shows us that seventy percent of U.S.
            employees aren’t showing up to work to their full
            potential<sup>17</sup>. They aren’t committed to delivering their
            best work every day. Even more? Over half of those employees feel
            like they’re on autopilot, simply cruising through their
            nine-to-fives. You don’t have to be an expert to enter an office
            full of corporate zombies. Expect to make mistakes and learn from
            them, just like everyone else. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Truth be told, many departments
            simply don’t know any better. We all have HR horror stories about
            how under-qualified our coworkers are. My experience alone speaks
            for itself: I’ve worked with full teams of “web developers” who
            literally couldn’t write a single line of code; designers who used
            PowerPoint as their main design tool; technical quality assurance
            “engineers” who couldn’t problem solve the simplest of computer
            issues. You get the gist. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>You don’t have to be an expert to
            work two full-time jobs or get eight hours of work done in half the
            time. You just need to have the right skills. More importantly, you
            need the right mindset and strategy. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Don’t be afraid to start
            as a contractor or outsource-ee. The best way to gain experience is
            to go out and do it. You instantly start earning your “years of
            experience” in the field the moment you declare yourself a
            freelancer. If you file a business license for your services—a
            process that takes about twenty minutes online—you officially start
            working for a company, even if it’s your own. Shift your mindset by
            viewing the skill-building process as practice. Offer your services
            for free or at a discounted price to gain experience and build a
            portfolio. Think of it as a valuable and inexpensive way to gain an
            education. If you’ve centered your career and education around time
            jobs, shifting your mindset to focus on value can take some mental
            energy. As soon as your perception shifts, however, your time will
            start to become yours. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>In the process, you will learn how to
            utilize the tools, resources, and automation available to you for
            your chosen field. You can even start by outsourcing many tasks
            right from the get-go. When you pick up a project, outsource the
            initial work to a contractor, or find online resources to jumpstart
            a project. As you ramp up and learn the tools of your pursued trade,
            you can optimize your workflows by outsourcing your work to start
            and then follow up with small tweaks and updates as needed. Hiring a
            subcontractor also allows you to tap into specialized knowledge and
            resources that may otherwise be unavailable to you. It’s like having
            an unofficial assistant and mentor all wrapped up in one. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>For
            example, let’s say your role requires you to create a marketing
            report for a client. Because you’re working smarter, not harder, you
            hire a subcontractor to do most of the initial work. The only skill
            you’ll need to know is how to make any edits or adjustments to the
            delivered project. Yes, it costs money, but it gives you time to
            juggle multiple jobs and gain experience without sacrificing your
            nine-to-five and five-to-nine. With the help of technology, online
            resources, and contractors, you can learn more, get more done, and
            earn more in less time. This means that deadlines are met, goals are
            achieved, and profits are increased—all while you get more
            unofficial “PTO.” These are all strategies we will dive into later
            in the book. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>This is just the beginning. Corporate America is
            designed to get the maximum value from its workers for the minimum
            cost possible. Play the game with them, and you can provide this
            value at the minimum time cost possible. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Reevaluate your
            average workday: How often are you working on tasks actually on your
            to-do list? Cut back the unnecessary emails, mindless internet
            surfing, and menial tasks, and you’ll discover how much of your time
            is wasted. By learning a value-based skill, you can leverage your
            efforts into something that pays off, whether that’s doubling your
            income or halving your work hours. The options are endless when you
            recognize and capitalize on the full benefits of the new-age
            corporate America. Time is money—don’t lose it by letting others
            spend it for you.

            TL; DR ( Too Long; Didn’t Read ) <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>—— <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Overemployment-friendly value jobs have five key traits: They are
            remote, with mid to large-sized companies, culture-friendly and
            slow-moving, and mid-level. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Mid-to-large sized companies, or those in the government sector,
            have the least work requirement and provide job security. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Look for liberal, wellness-focused companies that promote
            work-life balance. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • You can work two mid-level jobs and make more than you would in a

            “Where is your company loyalty?”
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Corporate America has convinced us that we should be as loyal
            to our companies as we are to our families, friends, and football
            teams. The truth is that the idea of working and staying loyal to
            one company died a long time ago due to corporate greed and lack of
            loyalty on the employer's part. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>As humans, we thrive off a
            sense of belonging. We have all been there: You get a new job, learn
            about the culture, values, and purpose, and feel that innocent
            desire to be a part of something bigger than yourself. To grow your
            career alongside the company. Company loyalty sounds good in theory,
            but there’s one catch: Loyalty goes both ways. It is a two-way
            street. For loyalty to exist, the company must be as loyal to you as
            you are to them. Yet this one-sided loyalty leads us down a path
            that often makes us more loyal to a corporation than ourselves.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Research shows that employees who are too loyal to their
            companies are less likely to “whistleblow,” even when their morals
            and ethics are compromised<sup>18</sup>. It’s how examples like the
            massive 2015 Toshiba fraud can happen. Toshiba’s corporate policies
            misled employees to think they would be rewarded for their loyalty
            and commitment—to the point that their senior managers were involved
            with accounting fraud for seven years. The company culture was so
            competitive that several leaders had intimidated their staff into
            manipulating the numbers in their accounting reporting period to
            boost profits. This led to massive fraud across the company, as the
            employees continued to lie due to a mixture of fear and obedience.
            It’s not that employees weren’t aware of what was happening—it’s
            that they remained quiet because they felt loyal to the company.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>This is an extreme example, but it’s a masterclass on the
            detrimental impacts of company loyalty. Company loyalty also
            prevents us from taking better opportunities for ourselves, our
            quality of life, and our families. Research shows that changing jobs
            typically increases your salary by ten to twenty
            percent<sup>19</sup>. It’s why several experts recommend switching
            your job every one to three years to maximize your
            income<sup>20</sup>. Being loyal to one company can cost you. While
            you can build relationships and grow in your position, it keeps you
            from learning new skills, gaining new experiences, and advancing
            your career. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Corporate loyalty is a slippery slope. Greed,
            lies, and a lack of transparency can quickly turn our innocent
            desire to belong into stretched morals, missed opportunities, and
            compromising situations. When your professional identity intertwines
            with your company’s identity, you make decisions that benefit the
            company rather than your career. And this is not altruism. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>If
            you were to make a mistake or contradict your company’s values,
            would they give you the same benefit of the doubt? Perhaps you
            stress and guilt-trip yourself, overthinking the decision to look
            for a new job when they would instantly look to replace you at any
            minor mishap. You sacrifice your health, well-being, and time for a
            company that’s likely calculated on a monthly basis whether or not
            it would save or cost them pennies to lay you off. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>It’s not
            that we shouldn’t be loyal at all to our companies, we simply need
            to redraw appropriate boundaries. Companies give us work. They sign
            our checks and help keep us fed. In exchange, you must do what’s
            included in your job description: Period. They employ you to get the
            job done. You work for them to get a paycheck. You are not a
            “traitor” for getting that job done in half the time or even taking
            a job that pays better. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>In today’s world, we must be loyal to
            our careers—not one company. Put yourself first, not your company;
            they would do the same. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>This all starts by finding value jobs
            that allow you to scale your income without sacrificing your time.
            You can find multiple jobs and prioritize your goals, career, and
            future by throwing out the outdated ideology of loyalty to one
            company.

            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>How to Find Value Jobs
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Searching for the right kind of job is integral in finding
            something that can be held down in conjunction with other work. In
            general, “juggle-able” value jobs have four traits in common. They
            are:
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Remote. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • With mid to large-sized corporations. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Culture-friendly and slow-moving. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Mid-level.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Let’s break down each trait and how to find these types of
            jobs.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Finding the Right Remote Jobs
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>First: You have to work remotely if you want to sell your
            value. Research shows remote workers save an average of seventy
            minutes per workday. That’s over an hour per day and nearly six
            hours per week saved simply by working from home. This is less time
            spent commuting, getting “office-ready” for work, and preparing for
            the journey. Working remotely already cuts down your forty-hour
            workweek by about fifteen percent<sup>21</sup>. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Yet, working
            remotely does not guarantee you will have six more hours to
            yourself. In the same study, remote workers use this extra time to
            perform twenty minutes of additional actual work than in-person
            employees. And this isn’t twenty minutes of playing catch-up. Many
            traditional companies are resistant to the idea of remote work and
            believe working from home makes us less productive. It’s actually
            the opposite. Eighty-six percent of the study’s participants were
            found to be more efficient at their jobs. Meaning, these extra
            twenty minutes remote workers spend aren't necessary. Instead, they
            likely result from the conditioned guilt and pressure we feel from
            our corporate jobs. With a few mindset swaps and actionable
            techniques we’ll discuss in the second half of this book, you’ll
            learn how to get the work done in just a fraction of the time.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Overall, having to go into an office is selling your time. You
            are packing meals, putting on business casual, and traveling before
            even starting your work. Even if you’re not busy or you’ve completed
            your tasks, you’re still required to be there. Your physical
            presence is mandatory, even when it doesn’t have to be. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>The
            plain fact is you cannot work multiple jobs from an office.
            Successful overemployment requires a methodical approach to
            organizing and compartmentalizing your jobs. You can’t be working on
            a project for one company while at an office for another. To juggle
            multiple jobs, the positions need to be remote with minimal travel.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Of course, the lifestyle benefits of remote jobs are appealing
            to many. This has made the remote work job market increasingly
            competitive. When you have to commute to physical office space, the
            applicants are limited to a twenty-mile radius. Remote jobs open up
            the competition to the entire country and, in some cases, the entire
            world. This doesn’t mean finding a remote job is impossible—it just
            means it requires a different strategy. We’ll break down ways to
            optimize your resume to get remote jobs in the next chapter.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>For now, you can start exploring remote job opportunities by
            understanding the remote corporate lingo. “Remote work” can have
            different meanings from company to company<sup>22</sup>.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Here’s a guide to help you identify the opportunities you’re
            looking for:
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Distributed Workforce: Everyone in the company works remotely.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Work-from-Home: Your specific role is remote. However, it may be
            limited to a certain region. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Work-from-Anywhere: This is extra flexible. You can work from
            anywhere in the world or even travel while working.
            Work-from-anywhere jobs are typically asynchronous, meaning you
            don’t have to worry about time zones or set hours. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Virtual or Online Job: All the work is done virtually; you only
            need a computer, laptop, or other devices to complete the work.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Remote-First: Typically, remote-first companies are structured to
            support remote work. These processes have shifted and adapted to
            support work-from-home, and the policies are generally
            wellness-driven, supporting work-life balance. Remote-first
            workplaces may offer more flexible and asynchronous scheduling.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Remote-Friendly: Remote-friendly workplaces offer flexible
            scheduling but are typically office-first, meaning the policies,
            processes, and procedures are shaped around the in-person employees.
            You may work from home, but you might have to adhere to the
            nine-to-five office schedule<sup>23</sup>.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>You can also find overlooked opportunities by searching for
            jobs that use the keyword “telecommute,” which is just a more
            corporate way of saying “remote.” <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Read the job description
            carefully. Even if it’s categorized as a remote position, many
            remote jobs are actually hybrid. They will require you to work
            in-office part-time. Some work-from-home jobs also have a location
            restriction. For either a legal, tax, travel, or client-based
            reason, the organization may require candidates to live in a certain
            state or region, even if they aren’t needed in an office. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>It’s
            important to note that because remote jobs are so coveted, there are
            plenty of remote job scams out there. Look out for
            too-good-to-be-true phrases in job descriptions or any application
            requiring upfront expenses or personal financial information before
            you have signed a contract. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>When getting started, there are
            several websites you can use to find remote job listings, including:
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • FlexJobs <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • We Work Remotely <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Remote OK <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Remote.co <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Virtual Vocations <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>

            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>You can also use more mainstream job boards like Indeed and
            LinkedIn—just filter by “remote” for the job type or location.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>As you start your search, remember that all remote jobs are
            not value jobs. You can work remotely as a teacher, customer service
            agent, or hourly laborer. Make sure you’re looking for value jobs
            you can juggle that are salary-based, not hourly-based. You can
            likely find many of these jobs in industries like marketing, graphic
            design, IT, development, data management, finance, HR, and
            recruiting. Many of these areas are “degree-blind,” meaning they
            care less about your education and more about the results you bring
            to the team<sup>24</sup>. If you can get the job done, it doesn’t
            necessarily matter how long it takes you. You want to find these
            value-driven roles that are task and project-based rather than
            time-based. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Some of the most notorious roles for
            overemployment include25:
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Creatives: Potentially the largest opportunity field for doubling
            and tripling stacked jobs, and the friendliest to degree-free
            applicants. Most think that creative roles require master skill sets
            in the arts, but almost all corporate creative roles can be learned
            quickly. With the help of today’s digital software, many creative
            roles are more dependent on knowing a specific software than actual
            hard skills. Pursue mastering the software that appears most
            commonly in job postings. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Software Engineers: Create, develop, and maintain software
            programs. You’ll need programming and development skills to do this.
            A computer science degree isn’t always necessary. Still, you will
            need to gain the skills through a certificate program or other
            route. In general, overemployment is especially popular (and
            possible) in the IT and development industry. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Product Managers: Gather research and analytics to prepare,
            launch, and sell a product successfully. There’s no set degree, but
            most companies expect you to have a bachelor’s in business,
            technology, or a related field. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • UX/UI Designers: Design the interface for products and services.
            You don’t need a formal degree and can get a UX/UI certificate in a
            few months. Overall, you’ll need design and technology skills.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Technical Writers: Write documents, how-to guides, and instruction
            manuals for products and systems. Again, you don’t always need a
            degree, but it helps. Overall, you’ll need writing skills and
            background knowledge in technology. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Project Managers: Set deadlines, assign tasks, and oversee a
            project to completion. Once again, there’s no standard education
            minimum, but most companies require a related bachelor’s degree or
            certification. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Data Engineers, Data Analysts, and Data Entry: While each role
            varies in qualifications and responsibilities, most jobs in data
            management are value-based and easily allow you to get your work
            done and walk away. Data entry is especially interesting, as it
            doesn’t require a formal degree.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Regardless of the value job you choose, remember this key
            overemployment rule: You must work as an individual contributor, not
            a manager. Individual contributors may often earn less than their
            managers, but they have significantly fewer time-based
            responsibilities. Managers spend most of their time checking in,
            supervising team members, and attending meetings. These are tasks
            you can’t outsource, streamline, or automate the same way you can as
            an individual contributor. While management is a great way to grow
            your career, it’s also a surefire way to increase your hours.
            Overall, look for a remote value job working as an individual
            contributor, not a manager.

            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Finding the Right Companies
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>As we know, most remote, value jobs don’t actually require
            forty hours of hands-on work. But some companies still do. The size
            and structure of the company can affect the responsibilities and
            time investment expected of you. Finding the right company is just
            as important as finding the right remote job. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>You don’t want
            to work for a company that expects you to work long hours, manage
            excessive job duties, and waste endless time in meetings. Much of
            this comes down to the company structure and culture. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>As a
            general rule, you’ll want to find remote jobs with mid to
            large-sized corporations or companies that are involved with
            government work. The definition of small, mid, and large businesses
            varies depending on the source, region, and industry. For the sake
            of this book:
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Small businesses are companies with less than a hundred employees.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Startups are young companies managed by the founder(s). <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Mid-sized companies have a hundred to a thousand employees. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Large-sized companies have a thousand to ten thousand employees.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Major corporations have more than ten thousand employees.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Let me explain: You do not want to work for smaller companies
            or startups because they actually need you to work. They likely
            aren’t involved in the over-hiring schemes many bigger corporations
            are. Typically, startup employees work fifty to sixty hours per
            week<sup>26</sup>. Their founders work even more, as the companies
            are in the pivotal growth stage. Many startups don’t have the budget
            to hire enough employees, meaning team members are often doing the
            work for two or more jobs. Most startups are built around the
            concept of “hustle culture.” Since many founders don’t have their
            own work-life balance, they often neglect the same for their
            employees. However, this is a general statement. There may be some
            exceptions to the rule—but for the sake of overemployment, it’s wise
            to steer clear of small business and startup positions. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>In
            contrast, you don’t want to shoot for jobs with major corporations
            like Apple or Amazon since they require high-level work, and the
            competition is fierce. Look up employee reviews for major
            corporations. You’ll find most offer many enticing benefits yet
            still require long hours and intense time commitments during new
            product launches and holidays. Just because a company offers
            flexible hours and schedules, it doesn’t mean that they necessarily
            require fewer working hours. Don’t fall victim to corporate
            buzzwords. Take the time to read employee reviews, looking for
            anecdotes about the working hours and overall pace of work.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>We’re looking for balance—and you can find this by aiming for
            the middle: mid to large-sized companies. These companies are likely
            out of the intense growth phase of startups and have the budget to
            hire enough (or too many) employees. Yet they aren’t as competitive
            as major corporations, requiring less work and time commitment.
            Large companies and major corporations have the most waste. They
            hire mostly for accounting purposes to reach a certain budget or
            headcount to reduce their tax numbers. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Another potential
            goldmine for overemployment is government-related jobs. Jobs in and
            around the government sector are the most slow-moving and require
            the least amount of work. We can thank excess “red tape” for this,
            as most projects and initiatives have to go through several approval
            flows before you can get much done. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Government jobs are also
            notorious for flexibility. Most government workers don’t work more
            than forty hours, and many departments are encouraged to adopt
            flexible, work-from-home schedules. Government jobs also offer more
            paid vacations and holidays than those in the private sector.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Mid-sized, large-sized, and government companies will likely
            be more organized than smaller organizations. This means there’s
            often more clarity of what is expected of you and a smaller need for
            constant meetings to organize things. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>You’ll need to do your
            legal homework before juggling a government job. Filter by federal
            and state government positions that offer remote and flexible
            scheduling. Note: You can’t work two federal jobs. You also can’t
            have outside employment that conflicts with your official work
            duties and responsibilities. Look at the department or agency’s
            written policies regarding outside employment. Those that allow
            outside employment often require that the second job isn’t related
            to federal work and doesn’t result in a conflict of
            interest<sup>27</sup>. This is a great lesson to learn when looking
            into any company for overemployment: Examine any publicly available
            policies regarding outside employment, and consider working with an
            employment lawyer to ensure everything’s above board. A company's
            overall culture and perspective on your employment can greatly
            affect your ability to juggle two jobs.

            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Finding the Right Culture
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>You must also assess company culture as you search for remote
            value jobs with the right company size and structure. The key to
            overemployment is finding a job that allows you the flexibility to
            balance your work and personal life. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>How do you know which
            companies are truly committed to fostering a culture of work-life
            balance? The answer lies in looking for progressive companies with
            forward-thinking, liberal values that don’t want to steal your time.
            These modern, new-age companies advocate for mental health,
            recognize employee burnout, and pride themselves on their commitment
            to work-life balance. They prioritize quality over speed and
            understand the importance of employee well-being. These companies
            will likely create roles with fewer hands-on working hours, more
            opportunities for flexible scheduling, and greater empathy and
            understanding for your personal life, especially compared to
            conservative, traditional companies that value company loyalty,
            hustle culture, and outdated formalities. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>When searching for
            an overemployment-friendly culture, it’s important to look out for
            certain “red flags” and “green flags” that can help you find the
            right opportunity—or save you from the wrong one.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Red Flags in Company Culture
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>We’ll start with the red flags. Let it be your first warning
            if you see any of the following in a job description30:
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Too many qualifications and requirements: They likely expect a lot
            from you. If the job description is essentially a long to-do list,
            run away. They might be looking for one employee to do the job of
            two. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Vague details: If the job description is rather general or vague,
            the company may be unclear about your duties and what they need from
            you. They’ll likely expect you to organize and figure it out on your
            own, on top of your ambiguous list of responsibilities. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Unlimited PTO: Another major overemployment red flag is “unlimited
            PTO.” In these policies, you won’t start the year with a set number
            of PTO days. Instead, you simply request days off when needed, and
            it’s up to your manager to approve them. Be aware, unlimited time
            off is actually used by most corporations as a tool for employees to
            take less time off. Studies have shown that workers at companies
            with unlimited time off tend to take significantly less PTO than
            others. While there can be some outliers where the company
            legitimately wants to give their employees as much time as needed,
            the far more likely scenario is the company is practicing tricks and
            tactics that hurt their workforce. This is where reading employee
            reviews will become especially helpful. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • “TBD” or missing information: Every company should tell you how
            much you’ll be making and the working hours. Your working hours are
            especially important for remote overemployment, as a flexible
            working schedule can allow you to better balance your
            responsibilities. You don’t want to be tied down to rigid working
            hours in a supposed “flexible” job<sup>28</sup>. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Toxic “hustle culture” buzzwords: Let’s translate the corporate
            buzzwords you need to steer clear of in overemployment: “Work hard,
            play hard,” “fast-paced,” “wears many hats,” or “rockstar”
            essentially mean the company has more than eight hours of work for
            you to do, but they don’t have the budget to hire multiple
            employees<sup>29</sup>. If the job description is looking for a
            “team player” to do “hands-on” work, the work environment is likely
            collaborative. This means they need your time, not just your value.
            If you see any of these keywords, it means they expect too much from
            you<sup>31</sup>.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Green Flags in Company Culture
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Now that you know what types of companies you should not work
            for, let’s look at the companies you should work for. Here are signs
            of company cultures that will likely support our goals:
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Wellness-focused: Look out for progressive keywords such as
            “well-being,” “workplace wellness,” “mental health,” or “work-life
            balance.” Companies that value your well-being aren’t likely to turn
            around and demand twelve-hour workdays. Of course, it’s best to know
            the difference between modern companies that offer free food and
            bean bags vs. those that actually care about your mental health.
            Find out if the company has corporate wellness initiatives, DEI
            programs, and employee development resources to back up their
            claims. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Paid-time-off: If a company talks about PTO benefits in their job
            description, it is a green flag. It is a major green flag if they
            have an above-average number of vacation days. As opposed to
            “unlimited PTO,” a high number of vacation days shows that the
            company actually expects its employees to take PTO. Pay attention to
            any additional PTO benefits, such as “paid sick leave,” “critical
            illness cover,” or “mental health days.” <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Flexibility: It’s one thing to offer remote work; it’s another to
            allow employees to curate their own schedules. Look for companies
            that use words like “flexible,” “customizable,” “on your own time,”
            or “async” when providing information about scheduling and work
            hours. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Hands-off: When overemployed, you don’t want to be stuck in a
            collaborative, hands-on work environment. Look for phrasing like
            “works independently” to find a role that isn’t micromanaged or
            team-based. However, these keywords may also be signs of “we don’t
            give you enough training or guidance to do the job well,” so tread
            lightly. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Transparency: Companies that share the pay, hours, benefits, and
            details of the role with clarity and specificity likely aren’t
            trying to trick you. It also indicates their hiring process and
            systems are more organized, which means less work for you.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>When determining a company’s culture, don’t just look at the
            job description—look at their website and social media. Employee
            review platforms will be your go-to guide in the process. Use these
            platforms to look at positive and negative reviews. When reading
            negative reviews, search for keywords such as “overworked,”
            “short-staffed,” “long hours,” and “micromanagement.” When reading
            positive reviews, search for keywords such as “work-life balance,”
            “flexible,” and “PTO” or “vacation days.” These should be taken as
            signs that they value their employees' well-being above all else.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Finding the Right Job Level
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>You’re looking for remote, value-based jobs with mid to
            large-sized companies. You’re ensuring they embrace a
            forward-thinking, wellness-focused culture. As the final step in
            finding the right job, you must make sure the role itself is at the
            right level. Search for mid-level jobs with average pay, and try to
            negotiate once you get an offer. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Low-level jobs don’t pay
            enough. In a junior position, you have to work to prove yourself,
            with little reward in return. Yet, in a senior role, you might be
            making significantly more, but it’s nearly impossible to fly under
            the radar. Senior positions often double as management roles,
            requiring much more time, effort, and collaboration. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>As we’ve
            learned, high-paying jobs tend to require high levels of work. But
            two easy mid-level jobs pay more and take much less effort. Think of
            it this way: You can work fifty-plus hours per week and earn a $100k
            salary with a senior-level job. This is impressive—but you can also
            work two $70k mid-level jobs, work forty hours or less, and earn
            $140k. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Mid-level jobs typically fall into the range of two to
            three hours of work per day. They pay well but without the
            additional responsibilities of a manager or senior employee. The
            goal with overemployment isn’t to get the highest-paying job but the
            lowest maintenance job. The goal is to, once again, fly under the
            radar: Deliver your work and check all the boxes without standing
            out too much. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>In 2023, the average annual salary for a
            mid-level job in the U.S. is just over $77k. Of course, this can
            range between $49k to $100k, depending on the region, industry, and
            company<sup>32</sup>. Mid-level roles typically require two to five
            years of experience, but it can vary. Typically, under two years is
            entry-level, five to eight years is mid-senior level, and anything
            above that is senior. Again, we want to aim for those mid-level
            roles for success in overemployment, even if you have over five
            years of experience. You won’t be able to juggle it all in an
            advanced role.

            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Using Recruiters to Build Your Network and Find Value Jobs
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>You now know exactly what to look for. You know where and how
            to find the jobs, companies, and roles that don’t demand your time,
            energy, and presence for forty or more hours per week. Now it’s time
            to attract those job opportunities. You can easily get started by
            connecting with recruiters. They can help you bridge the gap, build
            your network, and beeline straight to the opportunities.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>LinkedIn is the perfect platform to connect with recruiters
            and start building your network. Find recruiters from the companies
            you’re interested in on LinkedIn, and ping them directly. It’s good
            to remind yourself that most recruiters are trying to make it look
            like they’re working forty hours, too. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Don’t be afraid to hit
            up recruiters relentlessly; they do it to everyone else. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Take
            the time to perform some research and find recruiters who specialize
            in your industry or field. Once you've identified these individuals,
            reach out to them with a targeted message that clearly conveys your
            experience and skills. Be concise and to the point, highlighting
            your relevant experience and what you're looking for in terms of
            employment. Utilize any “green flag” keywords to qualify the job for
            your goals. If you say “work-life balance” and “flexible schedule”
            to a recruiter looking to hire candidates for a high-maintenance
            role, they might not forward your information to the team. This is
            good—they helped qualify the role for you. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Even if the role
            isn’t right for you, having recruiters on your side is never a bad
            idea. As you connect with recruiters, they become a key component of
            your job search. They often have access to flexible remote job
            opportunities that are not publicly advertised. They will turn to
            you first when the right opportunity comes up. This is particularly
            true in the current job market, where remote work has become the
            norm for many companies. By working with a recruiter, you may be
            able to find a role that offers the flexibility and culture fit you
            need for overemployment. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>When working with recruiters, it's
            important to remember that they are literally invested in your job
            search. After all, many only get paid or receive commission once
            they’ve successfully placed candidates in roles. This means that you
            can leverage their expertise and network to your advantage. Be open
            to their advice and guidance, and be sure to communicate clearly
            about your “must-haves” and “must-not-haves” in your next job. In
            the end, they will take a cut. Still, your goal is not the extra
            five or ten thousand in pay—it’s finding a job you can exploit,
            whether to turn a full-time job into a part-time job or retire
            early, thanks to your doubled salaries.

            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>The Overemployment Job Search
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>In the end, it’s not about finding the perfect job, it’s about
            finding the perfect job for overemployment. These are, first, value
            jobs: Jobs where you deliver value instead of trading your time.
            Secondly, they’re remote jobs. To own your time, you have to control
            where and how you work. To secure this control, you must work for an
            organization that respects your independence: A mid to large-sized
            company, or a government-related company, that isn’t hustling
            through its startup growth stage or competing for its way to the
            top. These are slow-paced companies that value your time,
            well-being, and work-life balance and are transparent in their
            expectations from day one in the job description. Lastly, seek
            mid-level jobs that don’t require you to prove yourself or manage
            the team. These are jobs where you can open your laptop, do your
            work, and mind your business without worrying about someone
            micromanaging you—or having to micromanage someone else. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>As
            you build your personal team of recruiters to find this job for you,
            you need a strategic resume to back it up. Turn the page, and we’ll
            start building it together.

            Corporate America is lying to you. They lie about the growth
            opportunities, job security, and positive work culture promised
            during interviews. They lie to you that they believe you, the
            employee, are one of their greatest assets. If that were true, they
            probably wouldn’t have laid off over 160,000 tech employees in the
            first five months of 2023<sup>33</sup>.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>With all these falsehoods, it makes sense why over half of
            Americans are also lying to Corporate America. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>A 2022 survey
            by StandOutCV found that over fifty-five percent of working
            professionals in the U.S. have lied on their resumes<sup>34</sup>.
            Companies stretch the truth about their roles and opportunities—why
            shouldn't candidates do the same? This is an ethics debate TikToker
            Alex Pearlman brought to light in a viral video with over 12.5
            million views in March 2023. Back in the 2008 recession, Pearlman
            shared that his friends were out of jobs, and their resumes suffered
            from the employment gaps. Around the same time, the once-leading
            American electronics company, Circuit City, went out of business.
            Tired of fighting for low-paying, entry-level jobs, his friends made
            a pact to cover each other’s references. They pretended they each
            worked in different positions at Circuit City. With the company shut
            down, there was no HR department to verify whether or not the
            candidates had actually worked there or not. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>None of them had
            worked there, of course, but according to their resumes and
            "references," they did. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Pearlman related this to the situation
            at Twitter after the purchase by Elon Musk. After thousands of
            layoffs, a former employee went to Twitter to check if he still had
            a job. The employee tweeted, tagging the new Twitter CEO to ask if
            he still worked for the company; his access to his work accounts had
            been shut off for nine days, but no one formally notified him that
            his employment had ended. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Musk replied, publicly mocking the
            employee’s disability and performance while working with the
            company. Between the aggressive replies and blatant lack of an
            off-boarding process, Pearlman said there’s no chance Twitter had a
            functioning HR department—and we should take advantage of it. He
            claimed that if Twitter is unsure who actually works there, they’re
            not taking the time to answer employment verification
            requests<sup>35</sup>. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Now, this is just one story
            representing the mess the corporate system is in. Don’t be afraid of
            overemployment. It’s not as complex as you might think it is, and
            corporations are littered with inefficiencies and holes like the
            example above. As we pull back the curtain on the hiring process,
            you’ll find it’s not that scary. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>The secret that many
            candidates don’t understand is that job pools are overloaded with
            unqualified and incompetent candidates. If you want proof of how
            inept, unprofessional, and under-qualified candidate pools are, put
            a simple ad on Indeed for a day. One survey showed that about three
            in four applicants do not meet all the requirements for a role—but
            they apply anyway<sup>36</sup>. Even the most seasoned, qualified
            candidates are not trained to write a resume and interview well.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>The moral of the story: Aim for high goals. If you’re
            determined enough to read this book, it's safe to say you can
            probably outshine the competition. If you follow a few common
            (albeit ethically questionable) practices, you will easily rise to
            the top.

            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>The Secrets of Resumes for Overemployment
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Rule #1 of overemployment resumes: Lie, lie, and lie some
            more. Everybody fudges their resumes, as the statistics show. The
            Google search “how to fake a resume” has increased by forty-eight
            percent in recent years. Research shows that previous work
            experience, skills, and educational history are the most common
            lies<sup>37</sup>. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Of course, it's important to know what to
            fudge and what not to fudge: <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>You can fudge your previous job
            titles. Now, if you were a sales representative, don’t lie and say
            you were an engineer. However, you may be able to get away with
            small changes to match the keywords of the job you’re applying for
            if the changes at least somewhat reflect what you did at your job.
            For example, suppose you’re applying for a marketing job in this
            scenario. In that case, instead of “sales representative,” you might
            add “sales and marketing representative,” as you likely worked
            somewhat in marketing and have skills that can apply to the
            role<sup>38</sup>. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>You can tweak dates to align with the “two
            to five years of experience” sweet spot of overemployment roles.
            I’ve even gotten several jobs by shortening my experience to fall
            into the under five years range. Remember that senior roles are
            typically responsible for actual work, so never go beyond five years
            of experience—and lengthening or shortening your experience to land
            in the two to five year range prevents you from falling into the
            category of “too-green” and “too-experienced.” Outside of
            overemployment, you likely want to be as qualified as possible to
            increase your pay, but you may need to conceal your qualifications
            to get the mid-level, low-maintenance remote jobs you’re looking
            for. If that’s the case, don’t be afraid to be overqualified; being
            under-qualified will make it difficult to stack jobs. If you have
            years of experience and two mid-level jobs, finishing your work in
            half the time will be much easier. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>You also can change or even
            omit the dates from your resume. No one really remembers dates. This
            is especially helpful for covering up any employment gaps and
            “references.” If they somehow do find out about any employment gaps,
            don’t be afraid to draw boundaries. They don’t need to know what you
            were doing during that time—you don’t owe that to them. If you were
            working on any side projects during that time, consider saying you
            were self-employed, working on improving your skills, or had signed
            an NDA<sup>39</sup>. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Overall, tread lightly around altering
            verifiable information, like the company you worked for, your
            degree, and anything a hiring manager can find out with a few calls
            and some social media stalking. Still, most companies do not verify
            any of this information. Over the fifteen-plus jobs I’ve had, I have
            not had a single one verify my degree, work history, or speak with a
            previous HR manager. A general rule of thumb is that the larger the
            corporation is, the more careful you should be, since they may have
            a larger HR team dedicated to verifying resumes. Be sure to have
            solid references. Reference checking is typically the only real
            follow-up that HR departments will perform.

            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Tips and Tricks: Resume Experience
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Remember: You’re applying for value jobs, not time jobs. You
            may only have half as much experience as they require. Instead of
            adding dates to each role, add years of experience to your skills
            section. For example, let’s say you only have a year of experience
            in development, but you do have several years of experience in
            technology and software throughout your previous professional,
            educational, and personal experience. Include these dates.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Extract skills from your general experiences: Have you worked
            with a team? This translates as communication, collaboration, and
            even leadership skills. Were you an assistant? You used your
            organizational skills to improve efficiency and productivity for
            others. Find the skills in your experiences, and use them to your
            advantage. Focus on the value you’ve brought to the table, not just
            the “years of experience" you've scored. Think in value, not time.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Research shows job recruiters think the same, with just over
            two-thirds prioritizing job background first. Their eyes go directly
            to your skills and experience, closely followed by potential culture
            fit<sup>40</sup>. Every detail of your resume doesn’t have to be
            perfect—but if you’re going to invest any time and energy into your
            resume, focus on building a solid, relevant experience section.
            Showcase your results, not just your responsibilities. Instead of
            copy-and-pasting your old job descriptions with vague details,
            emphasize what makes you a valuable asset to the team. How is hiring
            you a profitable investment for the company? <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>If you’re missing
            experience, and don’t want to flat-out lie, start your own business.
            When starting out, I created LLCs and provided my IT and design
            services for friends and family. I was instantly able to put this on
            my resume as legitimate experience. If you declare yourself a
            freelancer today, you immediately start raking in your experience in
            a new field instead of waiting around for a job. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Pro tip: When
            registering your business for freelancing services, choose something
            other than your name. This will make this experience look even
            better on your resume, as it will look like you’re working for a
            legitimate company (which you are, either way). <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>As you do so,
            offer your services to friends, family, charities, churches, and
            local businesses—for free if you need to. Plenty of organizations
            are looking for free work, regardless of your experience. One of the
            most untapped resources for expanding your portfolio is open-source
            projects. These projects typically only attract engineers and
            software developers, but most, if not all, would absolutely benefit
            from all types of skill sets. Contributing designs, marketing ideas,
            creative writing, or any other value to open-source projects not
            only helps your resume but can also help support great projects you
            believe in. There are many online resources, including CodeTriage,
            that maintain lists of projects needing help. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>You can also use
            platforms like Fiverr and Upwork to find projects, but be aware that
            the competition is fierce, and it will take some time to land a
            client. Start out with low prices, viewing the projects as valuable
            practice, resume-boosting experience, and portfolio-building
            opportunities for overemployment. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Still refining your skills?
            You can always begin by subcontracting the work to another
            freelancer, making your own tweaks and learning from their work as
            you expand your portfolio and job experience.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Tips and Tricks: Resume Education
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Remember: We’re looking for value jobs that prioritize skill
            over education. After all, the most common overemployment jobs don’t
            have strict education requirements; if you can do the job, you can
            get the job. One of the most important things that people outside of
            corporate America overestimate the value of is a college education.
            For almost all mid-level white-collar jobs, a degree is only a line
            item to get you past the hiring software and HR. Unless you are
            applying for a very specific role, no one cares what your degree is,
            what school you went to, or what your GPA was. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>If you are
            missing education, and don’t want to flat-out lie, getting a degree
            from an online university is cheaper and easier than ever. This is
            thanks to the ability to “test out” of many college courses, as many
            online colleges offer credits for passing different exams. While it
            may take sincere dedication and effort to study and pass these
            exams, the time saved can pay off exponentially. Many have received
            a bachelor's degree in less than a year through these programs.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>There are some legitimate online colleges that allow you to
            test out of courses and gain credits. Meaning, if you already have
            the skills but no formal certificate to prove it, you could get a
            degree much faster. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Some colleges include:
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Modern States offers a "free freshman year”, courses, textbooks,
            and materials included. All you have to do is enroll at a college
            that offers credit for passing established CLEP (College Level
            Examination Program) exams. Pass eight of these exams, and you’ll
            have an entire year of college credits under your belt for free.
            Pass enough, and you can get a degree. This can mean getting a
            degree in a substantially reduced amount of time<sup>41</sup>.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • University of Phoenix offers several benefits for working
            professionals. Aside from being an online college, they have
            multiple CLEP exams and other programs to shorten the cost and time
            requirements of a degree. For example, their Prior Learning
            Assessment (PLA) can translate your real-life experience into
            college credits. You can earn up to 30 credits for a bachelor’s
            degree and 15 credits toward an associate’s degree<sup>42</sup>.
            They also offer competency-based master's degrees where, considering
            your skills, you can finish in less than a year<sup>43</sup>. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Western Governors University is another online college that offers
            credit for prior learning. You can earn certifications and credits
            for passing exams in areas like IT, business, and even earn master’s
            degrees much faster than in-person colleges<sup>44</sup>.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Most colleges force you to put in the time to earn the
            diploma, but it just matters that you know the material. Again, it
            all comes back to time vs. value. If you’re worried these colleges
            don’t sound credible enough for your resume, you’d be wrong. A
            Gallup survey revealed that the majority of hiring managers don’t
            care where applicants graduate from. They just care about your
            knowledge, skills, and experience. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Still, suppose you want to
            gain these valuable skills a bit faster and don’t need an
            associate’s or bachelor’s degree. In that case, you can use several
            other resources to up your game. Courses, workshops, masterclasses,
            you name it: In today's digital world, you can find an online course
            on almost anything. Put yourself one step ahead of the crowd by
            completing a course that gives you a certificate. You can include
            these on your LinkedIn profile and resume to prove your knowledge.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>You don’t have to drop thousands of dollars on courses. There
            are several free and affordable online courses you can take to gain
            value-based skills, including:
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Harvard University’s free online course catalog. Yes, you can put
            Harvard on your resume, plus gain skills in areas like development,
            programming, data science, AI, and more. Many universities also
            offer free online courses to help boost your skills. These courses
            range in time requirements; some take months, weeks, or just a few
            hours<sup>45</sup>. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Coursera, Udemy, Class Central, and edX offer online course
            catalogs with a much larger range of free and paid program options
            you can take at your own pace. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Through the Grow with Google program, you can gain skills with
            three to six-month-long, self-paced certificates. The programs are a
            gold mine for value jobs, offering training in areas like
            cybersecurity, data analytics, digital marketing, IT, project
            management, and UX design—all very overemployable
            careers<sup>46</sup>. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Google it. Listen to a podcast. Watch a YouTube video. Most of us
            Google answers on the job, anyway. Spend your free time watching
            videos, listening to podcasts, and reading articles on how to gain
            your desired skill.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Once again, no one cares what school you went to or what your
            degree was in. It just needs to be a line item on your resume for HR
            not to reject you. They especially don’t care about your GPA. Don’t
            lie about your GPA—just don’t include it. Putting your GPA on your
            resume can actually work against you, making you look inexperienced
            and fresh out of college.

            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Making Your Resume Stand Out from the Crowd
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Only two percent of resumes result in an interview. The
            average recruiter scans a resume for less than six seconds. The
            average remote job gets at least 250 resumes sent in, and even more
            in the IT field<sup>47</sup>. First impressions matter, especially
            when you’re up against a surplus of remote applicants. Hiring
            managers don’t have time to read every detail of every resume. If
            your resume looks boring, it will be quickly tossed into the “no”
            pile. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Of course, these statistics are confusing, especially
            when you hear corporations complain about talent shortages. The
            truth is, it’s not that there aren’t enough applicants; it’s that
            most applicants do not know how to make a good resume. Nearly
            two-thirds of recruiters believe the biggest barrier to hiring is a
            talent shortage, not an applicant shortage. With your new skills,
            you can prove how you will bring value to the company. And with a
            professional, optimized resume, you can ensure you stand out from
            the crowd. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>If you want a leg up on the competition and to
            increase your chances of getting hired, you need to make sure your
            resume looks great. We’ll start by busting one of the most common
            myths in the corporate world: Designed resumes. Hiring managers and
            recruiters spend countless hours each day sifting through resumes
            with the same format, keywords, and design. If yours looks the same,
            there’s a slim chance it will make an impression. Design your resume
            to catch the hiring manager’s eye. Most people give the exact
            opposite advice, but in all my years of working in corporate
            America, I've gotten an interview at every single job I ever applied
            to using a heavily designed resume. Prove it to yourself: Hop on
            Google Images and search for “resume.” Given less than five seconds
            to scan each resume, which ones would you actually stop and read?
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>You can make a solid first impression by ensuring your resume
            is interesting, well-designed, and professional. This doesn’t
            necessarily mean including a headshot, twelve different colors, and
            completely unconventional formatting, but it does mean showcasing
            your creativity and personality through strategic fonts, pops of
            color, icons, and well-thought-out design. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Interestingly
            enough, heavily designed resumes can also help you know if the job
            is a good fit. Over-conservative, “work hard, play hard” companies
            don’t want designed resumes. By using a designed resume, you’ll
            likely filter out your “no pile” while attracting the more liberal,
            open-minded companies that don't want to steal all your time for the
            sake of “hard work and traditional values.” <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>If you’re ready to
            fully embrace the concept of value over time, consider hiring a
            professional resume designer and writer. Instead of spending hours
            designing your resume, use this time to gain experience in your
            field. Instead of forcing your brain to write the right words, use
            this time to search for the perfect overemployment job. Research
            even shows hiring a professional resume writer can increase your
            odds of getting hired by thirty-two percent. For professional
            resume-building assistance, you can use platforms like TopResume,
            ResumeCompanion, ResumeSpice, Craft Resumes, and Resume.com.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>If you’d still prefer the DIY route, a bit of design research
            and thoughtful formatting can help make your resume scannable.
            Imagine the average recruiter scanning your resume for six to seven
            seconds, only to spend most of that time desperately looking for
            relevant information hidden between giant paragraphs and irrelevant
            headings. If that's the reality, you won’t make much of an impact.
            Emphasize the most important information with bolded text, unique
            fonts, and colors. Ask yourself what you want recruiters to see in
            these crucial seconds, and make this information stand out. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            Need inspiration? Look at sample resumes and resume templates from
            graphic designers. Use their expert strategies to make sure your
            resume catches recruiters’ eyes. To get started, you’ll want to
            follow these lesser-known resume rules:
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Make your CV mobile-friendly. Three in four professionals use
            their phones for work purposes<sup>48</sup>. Many recruiters spend a
            good portion of their days scrolling through LinkedIn on their
            mobile devices. If they open your CV and it isn’t mobile-friendly,
            your first impression might flop. Check how your resume reads on a
            mobile device, and make any design changes needed, whether choosing
            a more legible font, breaking up paragraphs, or adding hyperlinks to
            your portfolio. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Use color psychology. You might spend twenty minutes figuring out
            which shade of blue shirt is more “professional” for your job
            interview. Apply the same amount of care when adding color to your
            resume. As a rule of thumb, darker colors can translate as more
            professional and luxurious, while brighter colors are more modern
            and creative. Cater the color scheme to the industry, and prioritize
            readability over style<sup>49</sup>. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Find the right font. Most resumes are written in Arial, Times New
            Roman, or Calibri. If you want to stand out, find a unique font that
            reads similarly. Consider using a different font for headings vs.
            paragraphs for variety. Overall, serif fonts work best for more
            conservative, traditional industries, while sans-serif fonts tend to
            speak to more modern, creative roles.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Your first goal is to get your resume past the HR departments
            and to the team manager. HR departments are typically filled with
            people who don’t know or care about the job. They likely don’t know
            the role-specific jargon. Pander to your target audience. Use
            keywords and industry buzzwords they'd understand. Impress HR, not
            just your peers. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Sometimes, you’ll need to get past another
            set of “eyes” before the HR department even sees you. Three in four
            recruiters and hiring managers use an applicant tracking system
            (ATS) to sift through resumes. If you’re unfamiliar with the ATS,
            it’s software companies use to track and manage candidates
            throughout the application journey. Instead of sorting through
            hundreds of resumes by hand, an ATS collects and sorts them, looking
            for specific keywords to help recruiters identify the best
            contenders. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>A study by job search services firm Preptel found
            that seventy-five percent of applications never even get seen by
            recruiters, thanks to an ATS<sup>50</sup>. While this can vary from
            company to company, an ATS can play a major role in helping
            recruiters choose which candidates go to the next round. Be sure to
            take advantage of this by including the keywords you see used in the
            job description. If you cannot work in the keywords naturally, a
            recent trend of “white-wording” resumes might be something worth
            considering: Add a portion of text to your page that simply lists
            all of the relevant keywords, but color it white so only computers
            will read it.

            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Building a Resume for Remote Jobs
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Making yourself hireable is one thing; making yourself
            hireable for a remote job is another. Getting all the work done in a
            fraction of the time requires the flexibility to work from home.
            Remember: Look for remote, preferably asynchronous, jobs you can do
            from anywhere at any time. If you want to truly stand out from the
            crowd of remote-job applicants, you must have the skills needed to
            succeed in the role—including the skills to succeed remotely.
            Working remotely requires self-management, discipline, and an
            understanding of today’s technology and software. Hiring managers
            and recruiters want to know if you can get the job done without
            physically being in an office. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>To increase your chance of
            getting a remote job, apply the following strategies:
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Include “remote” or “hybrid” in your job experience. If you have
            any experience working remotely, say so. Show that you not only have
            job experience, but you have remote job experience. This is another
            way freelancing will come in handy, as your experience here can
            double as remote experience. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Include your remote skills in your resume. Prove that you can be
            an employee and manager for yourself. When highlighting your skills
            and experience, include your familiarity with virtual communication,
            common remote work apps (Slack, Microsoft Teams, Zoom, Asana, etc.),
            technology, time management, working independently, and so on. Brand
            yourself as a low-maintenance employee who will get the job done
            without needing constant check-ups or help. By doing so, you can set
            the tone for success as you begin your journey to
            overemployment<sup>51</sup>.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Tailor each resume to the specific job position.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Once you have your well-designed resume, use it as a template
            you can easily tweak to match the job you are applying for. Research
            shows about sixty-three percent of recruiters want resumes
            specifically tailored to the job position. While you may be applying
            to two data analyst jobs, each company may have slightly different
            criteria. For example, one might focus more on the need for
            technical skills in certain software and tools like Perl and Python.
            However, the other might focus more on the desired soft skills, such
            as productivity and organizational and problem-solving skills.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>This includes tailoring your resume to match the company’s
            culture. One company might be passionate about innovation,
            creativity, and out-of-the-box thinking. At the same time, the other
            company might boast about its culture of learning, growth, and
            development. Cater the resume to your specific audience to show you
            are a good culture fit. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>This doesn’t mean rewriting your
            resume every time you apply for a new job. With a few simple tweaks
            in wording for your skills, experience, and professional summary,
            you can align your value with the company’s values.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Use Specific Keywords and Buzzwords
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Tailoring your resume to each job position requires you to
            understand how to spot keywords. As we know, many resumes won’t even
            see the light of day if they don’t have the right keywords, thanks
            to an ATS. Keywords are important words, phrases, and buzzwords a
            company puts in its job description to find the right candidates. In
            general, you can spot keywords by looking for:
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Industry-specific buzzwords (i.e., innovator, dynamic,
            results-oriented) <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Strong [keyword] skills (i.e., analytical, writing, design,
            organizational) <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Ability to [keyword] (i.e., identify problems, adhere to
            standards, think critically) <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Knowledge/understanding of [keyword] (i.e., SQL writing, digital
            marketing, risk management) <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Actionable tasks (i.e., coordinate schedules, code web apps, write
            sales copy) <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Names of industry-specific software and tools <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Capitalized, bolded, italicized, or repetitive words
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>You’ll find these keywords in the minimum qualifications and
            responsibilities sections of the job descriptions. Once you find the
            keywords, tailor your resume to incorporate them wherever possible.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>For example, let’s say your resume highlights your ability to
            design websites. One job position might include this in its
            description as “producing creative, one-of-a-kind designs,” while
            another frames it as “designing user-friendly, reliable web pages.”
            Both companies want a web designer. Yet each has slightly unique
            priorities. Customize your resume to align with what they’re looking
            for. Now, you don’t want to copy and paste the job description into
            your resume. Instead, look for the keywords and incorporate them
            into your template where relevant.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Building Your LinkedIn Network
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Now, take ninety-nine percent of what we talked about and
            apply it to your LinkedIn profile. Your LinkedIn profile is an
            extension of your resume. In some cases, recruiters may see it
            before they see your resume, meaning creating a hireable first
            impression is vital. In fact, as of 2021, three people are hired
            every sixty seconds on LinkedIn. Further research shows recruiters
            view LinkedIn as the most effective way to find talent, with
            eighty-seven percent of recruiters regularly using the
            app<sup>52</sup>. If you want to open up your job opportunities,
            build up your LinkedIn profile. However, to make the most out of
            LinkedIn, you must know how to use it effectively. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>First, you
            need to make sure your LinkedIn profile looks as good as your
            resume. Fill out every section and use every feature of your
            LinkedIn account. Your profile picture should be professional and
            reflect the personality of your desired role and industry. Your
            headline should be catchy and informative, highlighting your core
            skills and values. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Additionally, make sure your profile
            summary is well-written, concise, and informative. Remember: The
            goal is to make it easy for recruiters to see what makes you unique
            and how you can add value to their team. While you cannot tailor
            your LinkedIn to specific job descriptions, incorporate the general
            keywords you consistently find in your desired position to boost
            your chance of getting hired. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Think of what words recruiters
            and hiring managers are searching for when looking for the perfect
            candidate, and utilize them in your profile. Be sure to apply as
            many principles from your resume as possible, highlighting your
            remote skills and experience, emphasizing your value over years of
            experience, and clearly showcasing the unique skills you can bring
            to a company. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>With your profile ready, it’s time to build a
            solid network on LinkedIn. Connect with people who work in the same
            field as you, as well as those who share similar interests and
            values. Engage with them by commenting on their posts and sharing
            your opinion. This will help you build rapport and establish
            yourself as a thought leader in your field. You don’t have to become
            a LinkedIn influencer and post every day—but if you regularly
            highlight your career wins, valuable perspectives, and relevant
            skills, you can accelerate your job search. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>If you’re
            struggling to build up your connections, don’t worry. One of the
            easiest ways to expand your network is to connect with recruiters on
            LinkedIn. This will add legitimacy to your network and may even lead
            to job opportunities. Plus, it’s a key part of a recruiter’s job to
            make connections on LinkedIn. Most recruiters will almost
            immediately accept your request to connect. As a result, you’ll be
            able to increase your connections to support your profile's
            credibility and potentially build relationships that lead to your
            next job opportunity. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>However, make sure you optimize your
            profile before connecting with recruiters. When reaching out to
            them, be direct and professional. Explain why you want to connect,
            what jobs you’re looking for, and what you bring to the table.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Overall, treat your LinkedIn profile as your online portfolio.
            This means you should showcase your skills and achievements through
            work experience, projects, and education. Include examples of your
            work where possible. This will help you stand out from the crowd and
            attract the right job opportunities.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Creating a Portfolio that Proves Your Value
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>A resume summarizes your skills, knowledge, and abilities.
            Your portfolio proves it. Since you’re making the shift from time
            jobs to value jobs, you can give employers a sneak peek of this
            value by developing a solid portfolio. Your portfolio doesn’t have
            to be complex: Just take the time to gather any media files of your
            work, including videos, graphics, PDFs, or presentations. Include
            any testimonials, reviews, or positive analytics of your work to add
            an extra layer of trust and credibility. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>You can assemble this
            in a PDF file, set up a website, use a third-party portfolio
            platform, or create an article on your LinkedIn page to showcase
            your work. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Don’t have any work to showcase yet? Outsource it.
            While gaining hireable skills and experience, outsource relevant
            work samples to a subcontractor. Once they're delivered, make your
            personalized adjustments. Ensure you own the rights to the work once
            it’s paid for in your contract. If you’re highlighting work you’ve
            done for a past company, reach out and make sure you have permission
            to include it in your portfolio.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Finding References You Can Trust
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Almost everyone is “stretching the truth” in the hiring
            process, whether it’s the employers or the candidates. It's why
            eighty-seven percent of recruiters actually check your
            references<sup>53</sup>. Typically, this takes place near the end of
            the hiring process, once they’re about to make a decision, as it can
            take some time to contact your references. Essentially, their goal
            is to verify if you really are as great as you say in your resume.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Use references you can trust. Some research shows over
            seventy-six percent of employers have contacted references who gave
            negative feedback regarding the candidate<sup>54</sup>. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Make
            sure you have solid references (who will lie for you if needed).
            Again, this is where the "morally flexible guide" comes into play.
            If you’re careful, you can outsource your references. Get family or
            friends to back up your resume and advocate for you. If you start
            freelancing and provide services for them, they technically are
            clientele and can attest to your professional value. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>This is
            just the beginning. Before a company contacts your references, you
            need to get to the interview stage. Once there, you’ll be one step
            closer to your overemployment goals.

          <h2>Four: Ace the Interview</h2>
          <p>
            TL; DR ( Too Long; Didn’t Read ) <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>—— <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Don't think of an interview as a Q&A: Approach it as an actual
            conversation. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • For every question you’re asked, follow up with a question for
            them. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Prove you're a good culture fit: Be friendly, ask questions, and
            align yourself with the company’s goals and values. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • You’re interviewing them just as much as they’re interviewing you.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Use keywords in your interview to test whether or not the role is
            the right for your overemployment goals.

          <p>
            Corporate America is filled with traditions and customs we never
            think to question. Namely: the job interview process. It seems like
            it’s always been this way—a company needs employees, they post a job
            listing, flocks of eager applicants apply, and the company picks
            their favorite. What many do not know is that this is actually a
            relatively new process.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>In ancient times, there were no job boards—or jobs at all.
            “Jobs” centered around survival: hunting and gathering. As we
            evolved, societies from ancient Egypt to ancient Greece trained
            craftsmen through apprenticeship to carry on their work. Eventually,
            these jobs became a family business, with different trades passed
            down across generations. It’s why many last names represent the
            family’s work: Barber, Carpenter, Butler, Cook, Fisher, Hunter,
            Mason, Potter, Sheppard—the list goes on. If families didn’t have
            children to continue their work, they’d often find apprentices to
            replace them<sup>55</sup>. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Fast-forward to the Industrial
            Revolution, when factories suddenly needed mass amounts of
            employees. These employees didn't need complex skills—they just
            needed manpower. Candidates would often show up to the factory each
            day, hoping to be picked and thrown into the assembly line. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>As
            time passed and the U.S. evolved, more and more individuals started
            getting college degrees, and new means of transportation widened
            Americans' job opportunities. This meant more qualified candidates
            and increased competition. Now, companies would have to select the
            best candidates carefully. To solve this, Thomas Edison (yes, that
            Thomas Edison) created the first job interview in 1921: Edison
            created a written test to assess candidates’ qualifications. This
            questionnaire was leaked into The New York Times, and other
            companies used it as a model to form their own questionnaires to
            conduct interviews<sup>56</sup>. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Now, what does this have to
            do with you? Well, Edison’s questions were rather arbitrary. His
            questionnaire better resembled a game of Jeopardy, asking questions
            like “How is sulphuric acid made?” and “Who was Hannibal?” One of
            the foundational, often overlooked inspirations for today's job
            interviews stems from the 1917 Woodworth's Personal Data Sheet: This
            was essentially the first personality test. This list of 125
            questions was used to assess soldiers during World War I. It was
            intended to screen recruits and prevent those susceptible to shell
            shock (now known as PTSD) from enlisting. This test included
            questions like “Do you make friends easily?” and “Do you get used to
            new places quickly?” <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            While many of the questions are severely problematic and outdated,
            the data sheet influenced the personality and behavior-based
            questions asked in today's interviews. Instead of asking technical
            questions about our craft and skills, interviewers seek to get to
            know who we are. In the end, interviews are less about
            qualifications and more about culture fit<sup>57</sup>. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>The
            truth is, most people head into interviews with the wrong mindset
            and, as a result, they never seem to land the job. Now, I don’t want
            to give you basic interview tips you can find with a quick Google
            search like “Be on time,” “Dress your best,” or “Highlight your
            skills.” You’ve now entered the world of overemployment—and you’re
            going to approach interviews differently than you likely ever have
            before. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>In the past thirteen years of working in corporate
            America, I've had three realizations transform how I approach
            interviews. And in turn, they’ve transformed my results: <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Don’t think of an interview as a Q&A. Approach it as an actual
            conversation. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Being a good cultural fit is ninety percent of the battle. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • You need to relax. Everyone’s nervous. But if you don’t do
            anything about it, your nerves will run the show.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Interviews are a Conversation, Not an Interrogation
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>You’re not a suspect, and your interviewer isn’t a detective.
            Instead of preparing for a stressful, interrogation-style interview,
            shift your mindset. Treat interviews like a conversation, not a
            question-and-answer forum. As you make this switch, a few key
            improvements will happen: <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • First, you’ll connect with the interviewer in a more natural,
            collaborative way. You’ll give them a break from the formal
            "interrogations" and allow them to actually get to know you in an
            organic, human way. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Second, it will help you relax. No one likes to be put on the
            spot. If you tell yourself you’re simply going to have a
            conversation, not an interview, you’ll relieve most of the pressure.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Now, how can we actually do this? It’s simple: Treat it like a
            50/50 interview: They’re not the only ones trying to figure out if
            you’re the right fit for their company; you’re equally testing the
            waters to see if their company is the right fit for your career
            goals. The more you treat an interviewer like you're the one
            interviewing them, the more confident you will seem. In this
            mindset, you’re no longer trying to convince them that you’re good
            enough—you need them to convince you that they’re good enough.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>A normal conversation is never one-sided. Each party asks and
            answers questions, tells stories, and follows up for more detail to
            show they’re interested. Start simple: Try to ask a follow-up
            question for every question they ask. Start conversations around
            each question. Here’s an example using a common interview question:
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>“How do you deal with stressful situations at work? <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Your
            interviewer wants to know if you can remain calm, cool, and
            confident under pressure. They want to know if you’ll follow the
            standard procedure for conflict and if you can manage problems on
            your own. In short? They want to make sure they won't have to
            babysit you. They want to test your judgment to see if you know what
            types of issues to solve on your own and which to take to
            management<sup>58</sup>. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Answer with personality. Instead of
            giving a cookie-cutter response, tell a story. Paint the picture,
            telling them about a time you stayed calm and handled conflict like
            a pro. Share the specific actions you took to find a resolution. Let
            them know what you do to stay calm and keep stress at bay.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Then, as any natural conversation would go, end by asking them
            a question. There are a few ways you can flip this example around.
            You might ask: <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>“How does the company typically prefer the team
            to handle conflict?” <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>“Has the team dealt with any similar
            situations recently? If so, how did they handle it?” <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>“What is
            a common stressful situation I might find myself in if I take on
            this role?” <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>“What resources does the company have to help
            manage workplace stress?” <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>These questions show you’re
            confident. They show you’re choosy. They show you’re curious. They
            communicate that you want to learn about the company. Plus, they can
            discreetly help you determine if they're a good culture fit for
            overemployment. Want to weed out the jobs that just won’t work for
            overemployment? Drop questions and answers using keywords like
            “family-time,” “work-life balance,” “flexibility,” and “workplace
            well-being.” Refer to the "Green Flags in Company Culture" section
            in Chapter 2 to find the keywords indicating a progressive, balanced
            workplace. Use these words in your interview. Some companies may be
            all "talk" and zero "walk." Put them to the test by seeing their
            reaction to these buzzwords. Ask what systems they have in place to
            ensure these benefits and values. If you’re worried this will lose
            you the job, good—you don’t want to be hired by a company that wants
            to steal your time.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Culture Fit is King
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>You can be the most qualified candidate on the roster, but if
            they don’t like you, you probably still aren’t going to be hired. A
            lot of the time, your interviewer doubles as a future coworker. It’s
            not uncommon to have your potential team manager sit in on your
            first or second-round interview. This isn’t just to see if you have
            the right skills, it’s to see if your personality will mesh with the
            team. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>In one study, ninety-one percent of hiring managers said
            culture fit is equally important or even more important than a
            candidate’s skills and experiences<sup>59</sup>. In another study,
            nearly half of the recruiters said they’d reject a candidate if they
            didn’t know much about the company<sup>60</sup>. When it comes down
            to it, your resume showcases your qualifications, but your interview
            proves whether or not you’re the right culture fit. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Before you
            get mad about this, remember: It helps you, too. Nearly three in
            four employees quit because they don’t align with the company’s
            culture. Culture fit increases job satisfaction by ninety percent,
            job performance by eighty-four percent, and overall respect for the
            company by seventy-eight percent<sup>61</sup>. Understanding a
            company’s culture is one of the most effective ways to determine
            whether or not the job is “juggle-able.” <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>From this
            perspective, you have two main objectives: Show them you’re the
            right culture fit, and find out if they’re the right culture fit for
            you. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>You can show you’re the right fit by being as friendly as
            possible. Recruiters are exhausted from sitting in on robotic,
            Q&A-style interviews. If you want to stand out from the crowd, use
            your conversational skills. Smile, laugh, and joke like a human.
            Show them you’d not only be a great employee but a great coworker.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Pro tip: Imagine that the interviewer already likes you.
            Convince yourself that they already think you’re the right fit. Now,
            you’re just trying to figure out if you like them. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Of course,
            you can find this answer during your interview. You can save time
            beforehand by reading media articles about the company, scrolling
            through online employer review sites, and talking to previous
            employees. This will help you determine if they’re the right fit
            while also giving you the insights you need to show them you’re the
            right fit. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Another great strategy is to utilize the keywords
            the company was looking for in your resume. Find a way to sneak them
            into your interview conversation, as well. For example, let’s say
            you’re interviewing to become a project manager. Research shows some
            of the top keywords for project management roles include
            “compliance,” “facilitation,” and “innovation”<sup>62</sup>.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>During your interview, share stories about the quality of your
            work, using words like “compliance.” Ask about how the company
            inspires “innovation” and what you can do to “facilitate” it. To
            successfully achieve this, you’ll need to be organized. This is
            arguably one of the most essential skills in overemployment. If you
            struggle to organize your duties for one job, you might not be able
            to handle two. Set the tone for your organization skills by keeping
            records of the keywords or information you used for each job
            application. It can be a simple document or spreadsheet. When you
            get an interview, you can pull up this file, find your keywords, and
            prepare to incorporate them into your conversation. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Side note:
            If you’re worrying about keeping two jobs organized, take a deep
            breath. We’ll break down the ins and outs of juggling and
            compartmentalizing two jobs in Chapter 8.

            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Be Cool, Calm, Collected, and Confident
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>The first ninety seconds are the most crucial part of any
            interview. One in three interviewers claim they quickly make a
            decision about a candidate in this short yet pivotal timeframe. If
            you’re stressed, disorganized, and on the verge of panic, it’s easy
            to drop the ball here<sup>63</sup>. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>It’s all about the first
            impression. And thirty-nine percent of candidates fail to nail this
            impression, losing the slot not due to their skills or
            qualifications but their lack of confidence in their verbal and
            nonverbal language. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Actions speak louder than words,
            especially when it comes to interviews. Research shows our nonverbal
            communication—whether pitch and tone or posture and facial
            expressions—is more powerful than our actual words. It’s why someone
            can say they’re confident, but if they’re looking at the ground,
            slumping their shoulders, or speaking quietly, we aren’t likely to
            believe them<sup>64</sup>. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Communicate confidence through your
            body language and tone. This doesn’t necessarily mean you need to be
            loud. Loudness doesn’t equal confidence. Calm equals confidence. If
            you’re confident, there’s no need to be nervous. Confidence and
            calmness put you and the interviewer at ease. If your communication
            style shows that you’re questioning whether or not you’re qualified,
            your interviewer will be forced to do the same. But if you believe
            it, you’re already halfway there. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Again, this starts with our
            body language. Not only can it convince others that we’re confident,
            but it can make you feel confident. Before logging onto your
            interview, practice some "power poses." Pioneered by Social
            Psychologist Amy Cuddy, power poses are essentially postures that
            trick our brains into feeling confident. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Research shows "power
            posers" find it easier to stay calm and collected, exude confidence,
            and engage others with their communication. One study showed that
            candidates who use power poses receive significantly higher
            performance evaluations than those with closed-off body language,
            like crossed arms or legs, hunched-over shoulders, and avoidant eye
            contact. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>The same study even showed that power posers had
            lower levels of cortisol—the “stress hormone.” Even spending just
            two minutes power posing before your interview can shift your
            energy<sup>65</sup>. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Try it for yourself:
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • The Victory Pose: Stand tall and raise your arms above your head
            like you’re celebrating a big win. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • The Wonder Woman: Stand with your legs shoulder-width apart. Lift
            your chest and head, and place your hands on your hips, just like
            the iconic superhero. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • The Loomer: Stand behind a desk or chair and place your hands on
            it. Lean slightly forward, like you mean business.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Ninety-three percent of us feel anxiety during a job
            interview<sup>66</sup>. It’s normal to feel a bit nervous—but if you
            have severe interview anxiety, do what you need to do to calm your
            nerves and focus on the present. Now, I’m not exactly saying that
            you have to reach out to your physician to get a Xanax… but whether
            it’s yoga, breathing exercises, power poses, or a little help from
            your doctor, do whatever it takes to present your most confident,
            cool, and collected self.

            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Preparing for Virtual Interviews
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Remember: You’re looking for a remote job. This also means a
            remote interview process. While it can vary from company to company,
            many virtual job application processes include a phone interview and
            one to two video conference interviews. While the overall structure
            may feel the same, remote interviews can be very different from
            in-person interviews. By knowing how to prepare, you can use the
            unique setup to your advantage. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>You should also remember that
            the interview starts before the actual interview. Nearly two in
            three recruiters say they often lose candidates before even
            scheduling an interview<sup>67</sup>. This is often due to late
            replies, unprofessional email addresses, and unclear communication.
            When applying to remote jobs, you must reply as quickly as possible.
            Ensure your email notifications are on, and answer your phone calls.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Throw away the “strong handshake” advice only applicable to
            in-person interviews. Remote interviews require a new technique to
            show you’re confident and engaged. In fact, one study showed that
            eighty percent of candidates who don’t get the job appear
            "distracted" during the virtual interview. Their lack of preparation
            for the format makes them fail to connect and engage in interesting
            conversations. In the same study, those who failed often looked like
            they were reading a script<sup>69</sup>. This is the last way to
            form an authentic connection. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>When preparing for a remote
            interview, keep these strategies in mind:
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Create a cheat sheet. Create a doc with notes about the company,
            role, and experience you want to highlight. Pull up the sheet on
            your screen and only reference it if necessary. Just be sure you
            don’t read it like a script. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Set the scene. Match the workplace's dress code, at least from the
            top up. Clear your background, and make it look like you’re in a
            professional office space. The more organized you look, the more
            ready you’ll seem for remote work. If your background is
            distracting, they’ll focus on it, not you. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Prepare your technology and tools. Check your lighting and clean
            your camera. Test your mic, camera, and video conferencing software
            beforehand. Make sure the software is downloaded, updated, and ready
            to go. Run an upload speed test on your internet to ensure you don’t
            freeze up or experience technical difficulties. Research shows that
            eighty-eight percent of recruiters are the most annoyed by an
            internet lag that disrupts the conversation. The more technical
            difficulties you experience, the less likely your interviewer will
            think you’re capable of working from home successfully. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Adjust your nonverbal communication. You’re used to looking into
            your interviewer’s eyes. To have this same effect, you’ll need to
            look directly into your webcam. If you look at their face (or your
            face) on the screen, it will look like you’re unfocused or
            distracted. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Slow down and speak loudly and clearly. Talk like you would
            normally, using natural hand gestures, a strong posture, and open
            body language to communicate your confidence. Add personality to
            your words, and actively show you’re listening. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Stay candid. In the same study, eighty-nine percent of candidates
            who got the jobs talked conversationally. They asked follow-up
            questions about the company's resources, tools, and benefits. They
            looked for common interests to bond over, especially when the
            conversation came to a lull or the interviewer looked bored. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Take notes during your interview. Write down questions you want to
            ask later and note any questions you fumbled. Use the time at the
            end to recover from these slips and learn for next time. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Stay “in character” after the call. It can take a few seconds to
            fully log off an interview. Don’t instantly drop your smile, give a
            sigh of relief, or talk smack about your interviewer—at least wait
            until you’re fully logged out of the call.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Practice, Practice, and Practice
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>In the end, interviewing is just another professional skill.
            The more you practice, the better you’ll be. Don’t wait for “game
            day” to start practicing—start now. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>If you don’t want to
            practice mock interviews with your friends or family, there are a
            host of online resources you can use to refine your
            skills<sup>69</sup>. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Some include:
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Gainlo: A platform that connects you with experienced interviewers
            from top companies like Google, Microsoft, and Adobe via video
            conferencing. They’ll conduct a mock interview, and you’ll get
            feedback immediately afterward. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • SHRM Resources: The Society of Human Resource Managers offers free
            sample interviews based on some of the top company’s actual
            interview processes. They also offer webinars, analyses, interactive
            tools, and valuable insights from hiring managers’ perspectives.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • LinkedIn Premium Account: If you’re taking your LinkedIn strategy
            seriously, consider upgrading to a premium account to get interview
            feedback from coaches and mentors.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>If you’re more of a DIY learner, don’t worry—a few Google
            searches can go a long way. In fact, interviewers are often just as
            burnt out and underprepared as candidates. If they don’t have a set
            interview process, many interviewers Google questions to ask you
            before an interview. Beat them to the punch by looking up the most
            common questions for your field or role. From here, you can not only
            prepare your answer but also prepare conversations around all
            possible questions.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Accepting and Negotiating
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Let’s say you’ve applied all of these tips. You took charge of
            the interview, turning it into a conversation instead of an
            interrogation. You stayed calm, cool, and collected, claiming your
            confidence. You’ve not only proved you’re the right culture fit, but
            you took steps to ensure they’re the right culture fit. Now, you
            have a job offer. What’s next? <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>If you aren’t negotiating your
            job offer, you’re leaving money on the table. In fact, seven in ten
            hiring managers expect salary and benefits negotiation. Other
            surveys show even more, with eighty-four percent of employers
            expecting negotiations<sup>70</sup>. Most job postings and offers
            start at the minimum offer, leaving room for negotiation. If you
            don’t haggle, you’re likely leaving behind money that was already
            budgeted for the role. The worst part is, over half of Americans
            accept the initial offer with zero negotiations. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>To cash in on
            a corrupt corporate America, you need to negotiate. Surveys show
            eighty-five percent of candidates who counteroffer are successful,
            and eighty-seven percent got at least a portion of what they asked
            for<sup>71</sup>. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Negotiation is simple: Go high, they’ll go
            low, and you’ll meet in the middle. The real key is confidence. Back
            your statement with numbers and facts. Research the average salary
            of the position in your area, itemize the unique value you bring to
            the table or any costs you may experience taking on the role. For
            example, include the additional skills or experience you have
            outside of the basic job requirements. Make sure you approach it as
            a partnership: It’s not you vs. them. Stay likable while asking for
            what you want. Make it clear that you’re serious about the job and
            want to make the offer work for everyone involved<sup>72</sup>.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Negotiating vacation days is the easiest way to increase the
            value of your job offer. Companies are significantly more likely to
            add a few days of PTO to their offer than more cash. Plus, this
            flexibility will make your overemployment goals that much more
            possible. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>If you’re respectful and intentional in this
            process, the worst that can happen is that they say ‘no’ to your
            offer and you get to choose whether or not to accept the initial
            offer. The best that can happen? You get a new job with more pay or
            benefits. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>This is only the beginning. Next, we’ll begin to
            dive into the world of overemployment: Starting with your first
            ninety days.

          <h2>Five: The First 90 Days</h2>
          <p>
            TL; DR ( Too Long; Didn’t Read )
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>—— <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Never tell anyone about your overemployment. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • The first 90 days are the most important: Becoming an
            irreplaceable team member quickly is key. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Establish yourself in the company: Work hard and do a good job,
            understand the company culture and fit in, and be aggressive about
            your goals. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Find a project you can make your own: Look for neglected or vital
            areas of the business to take responsibility for. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Make friends at work. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Become a project leader, not a project manager.

          <p>
            You’re in. You’ve got your first "overemployment-able" job, and
            you’re ready to take advantage of the system.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Before you start juggling, you need to find your corporate
            rhythm. Even circus clowns can’t start juggling twenty items at
            once. You start with one, find your pace, establish your flow, and
            begin to add more. This is what the first ninety days are for.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>The first ninety days of employment are often called the
            “Orientation and Evaluation” period: The three months your employer
            uses to determine whether you’re an asset or a liability to the
            company. For overemployment to work, you need to take hold of this
            narrative. You must establish your roots, set expectations, and find
            exploits to keep your job and find time to work another. In our goal
            to work less, you’ll have to input more—at least for the first
            ninety days. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Twenty percent of employee turnover happens in
            the first ninety days<sup>73</sup>. Whether the new employees leave
            or the company cuts ties, it’s an employment experiment for
            everyone. This ninety-day period is the most important part of
            preparing to work multiple jobs because it's also the timeframe in
            which you make first impressions. It’s where you get to pull the
            strings, set expectations, and choose to take on responsibilities
            that can be automated or outsourced.

            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>First Impressions & the First Ninety Days
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>How you act in the first three months sends a message to your
            team. The right message can lay the groundwork for successful
            overemployment or cripple your goals. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>You see, first
            impressions are a science. Research shows that in just seven
            seconds, people form a first impression of you<sup>74</sup>. Think
            of your first ninety days as a stretched-out version of these seven
            seconds. It’s your chance to influence how you’re perceived and
            choose how you'll move forward. Now, this doesn’t mean you need to
            stress over what everyone thinks of you. Instead, think of it as
            claiming and owning your role within the company. Don't let your
            first impression happen to you–create it yourself. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>First
            impressions aren’t always accurate, but they are powerful. To
            understand this, we need to understand the psychology of it all.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>First impressions are a bias. They cause us to form quick,
            uninformed opinions and generalizations about others based on the
            smallest details. These impressions are then worsened by two other
            biases: Confirmation bias and the halo effect<sup>75</sup>.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Confirmation bias is the idea that we find what we look for.
            Let’s say you log on late on your first day. You're scattered and
            running behind. People will likely form a first impression that
            you’re lazy or disorganized. From there, any disorganized or lazy
            behavior you display, even the slightest misstep, will only confirm
            their bias further. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>It works the other way, too: Imagine you
            show up strong on your first day, coming across as confident and
            bold. Even if you’re not, your coworkers will look for signs and
            behaviors that confirm this belief: Any display of confidence you
            show after that is amplified and solidifies your reputation.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>This lays the groundwork for the halo effect: A positive first
            impression defines your reputation as a whole. Often, this is
            problematic. For example, if someone's attractive, people will think
            they're smarter, cooler, or more successful than they might actually
            be. It goes to show that if people like you at first, they’ll be
            more apt to like you later. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>This significantly impacts us in
            the workplace. Research suggests the halo effect influences team
            managers when assessing performance reviews<sup>76</sup>. If you
            succeed well in one area, managers tend to translate this as success
            in all areas. Let’s say you’re known for having a positive attitude
            at work. If this reputation is strong enough, your manager might
            generalize this as competent in all areas, not just your attitude.
            But if you quickly set a poor impression for yourself, you can get
            penalized and generalized as a bad employee. Let’s say you’re great
            at your job, but you’re known for forgetting deadlines and meetings.
            This reputation can cancel out your quality work, affecting your
            performance reviews as a whole. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>It’s unfair. It’s unbalanced.
            But it is real. Just like all injustice in corporate America, you
            can use it to your advantage: With a bit of planning, you can prime
            your managers and coworkers to see you in a way that helps you keep
            your job and work fewer hours.

            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Ground Rules for Onboarding & Overemployment
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Before we learn how to do that, let’s establish a few ground
            rules for overemployment:
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Never tell anyone about what you’re doing: It’s your business,
            and no one is entitled to it. Sure, tell your family (at least your
            less gossip-prone family), but you don’t need to tell all your
            friends, especially your work friends. Know who you can and can’t
            trust.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Don’t onboard two jobs at the same time: Start with one. Once
            you set up, automate, and outsource your workflow, you can use your
            spare time to search for your second job.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>In order for overemployment to work, you need to treat the
            first ninety days like a sprint. You won’t be working three-hour
            days the first week, and that’s okay. The first three months are
            where you’ll put in the most work to establish yourself in the
            company. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>And here’s how to do just that: <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Establish
            Yourself in the Company
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Make your ninety-day game plan. Research shows the first
            ninety days determine the perception of the value you bring to the
            company. That means your goal is to become an important team member
            as quickly as possible. Stay hired by establishing yourself with the
            company. Once you establish yourself, you discover a lot more
            freedom. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            If you frame yourself as an outsider, you’ll constantly be trying to
            prove yourself. As an insider, you take back more control: You can
            do a good job and work three hours a day. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Overall, there are
            three key steps to establishing yourself in the company:
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Step 1: Work hard and do a good job.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>There’s no other way around it. Think of your first ninety
            days as an investment: The more work and strategy you put in now,
            the less work you have to do later. In the global workplace, nearly
            three in five employees perform only their job requirements, and
            even more aren’t actively engaged in the work<sup>77</sup>. This
            means the majority of workers are doing the bare minimum. This isn’t
            overemployment. Overemployment is about delivering the value you
            promised; “quiet quitting” is about clocking in and clocking out.
            Once again, it’s the battle of time vs. value. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Want to stand
            out in the first ninety days? Be engaged. Companies view your
            connection to the company as commitment. Strive to be proactive,
            engaged, and enthusiastic. Approach your work from a value-based
            mindset from day one: Find your team’s goals, challenges, and
            priorities, and make it your job to contribute to these goals, solve
            these challenges, and uphold these priorities.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Step 2: Understand the company culture and fit in.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Try to really understand the full domain as quickly as
            possible. Take the time to learn about the company's culture,
            mission, and values, and identify ways you can contribute to its
            overall success. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Show that you can be trusted. This doesn’t
            mean putting on a fake persona each day—most people can tell when
            you’re being fake, which, of course, has the opposite effect.
            Instead, do your best to find common ground. People trust those they
            can connect with. Learn the language, lingo, and customs of the
            workplace culture. Focus more on what you have in common with your
            coworkers and less on what you don’t. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Don't forget to take
            notes. Become an expert on the company so that by the time you start
            your next job, you already have all the information you need, you’re
            in a flow, and you can finish your work in no time. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Get
            involved in as much as you can. Be aggressive about learning and
            understanding the inner workings of the company. Find the key
            players: The decision-makers, leaders, and unofficial leaders within
            the company, and make your mark. Network, engage, and observe. When
            in doubt, listen, don’t talk. Get to know who they are, who the team
            is, and what the company is all about. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Match the overall
            energy of the virtual office. Believe that you’re already a part of
            the team, and you’re halfway there.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Step 3: Be aggressive about your goals.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Communicate your long-term goals with your manager early on.
            Even if you have plans to quit in three years, they don’t need to
            know. That information is yours to share. Be willing to take on new
            challenges and responsibilities in the first ninety days. Share your
            goals with your manager. Show that you mean business. Doing so can
            set you up for long-term success and establish a positive reputation
            within the company.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Remember: Establishing yourself in the company is establishing
            your first and lasting impression. If your first impression leads
            people to believe you're a hard worker and go-getter, no one will
            bother you later down the line because they will assume you are
            still doing a good job.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Stand Out: Become a Key Team Member
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Story time: I once worked for a company that had to migrate
            all of their Google Docs and Google Sheets files into a new document
            management system. They were going to hire a team to complete the
            data entry over six months—and it was going to cost the company a
            fortune. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>So, I buckled down to see what I could do. When I
            realized I could automate the entire process, I told management I’d
            take care of it for them in nearly half the time and at none of the
            extra cost. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>This was mostly true. I provided value in the two
            main areas companies care about: Time and money. I did save them
            tens of thousands of dollars. I did get it done in less than six
            months. But truth be told, I automated the process in three to four
            days—and just acted like it took three to four months. It was a
            win-win: They didn’t have to hire anyone, and I hardly had to work
            for an entire quarter. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Overemployment isn’t “quiet quitting.”
            It’s providing value and, as they say, “working smarter, not
            harder.” You can set the tone by making yourself stand out as an
            essential team member and hard worker, while not necessarily having
            to work so hard. You can achieve this by finding projects and tasks
            you can own. These are projects that either:
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • No one else wants to touch: They’re boring, mundane, or
            repetitive. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Exist outside of your team. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Cater to your specialized skills. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Classify as ‘business-critical.’
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>By claiming these types of projects in the first ninety days,
            you can take control of your schedule in a way that makes
            overemployment easy. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Let’s break this down: <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Consider
            volunteering to help with projects that no one else will touch.
            These are areas of the business that are neglected or no one else
            wants to pay attention to. Often, they’re tasks that need to get
            done but aren’t directly in anyone’s job description. Most people
            hate busy work, mundane work, or repetitive work, but this type of
            work is typically the easiest to automate or outsource. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            Here’s an example: Let’s say you’re a marketing strategist. After
            just a month of working in your role, you notice that everyone
            procrastinates in creating marketing reports to share across the
            company. No one on the marketing team wants to spend hours gathering
            data, writing summaries, and designing reports everyone will
            understand. So, you step up: You say you have experience creating
            reports and would be happy to help oversee them this quarter.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>With the help of your favorite automation (which we’ll go over
            in Chapter 7), you use software or a tool like Looker Studio to
            automate and transform your data into visual, simplified reports
            with a few clicks and customizations. Once the team likes what they
            see, you'll schedule the reports to be automatically created and
            exported. You even take it to the next level, scheduling these
            reports to send out to stakeholders on a regular basis<sup>78</sup>.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>By taking this project on, you demonstrate your ability to
            identify inefficiencies, improve processes, and do the work no one
            else will. Plus, you’ll be able to streamline and schedule them to
            your liking. When the project is yours, you get to tell them how
            long you need to complete it. Establish the expectations from day
            one, and you’ll be able to block out time in your schedule to “work
            on the reports,” when in reality, they’re already automated,
            scheduled, and prepared. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>My data entry story is the perfect
            example of this. It was a project meant for interns, but that didn't
            matter. I knew that being in charge of a project no one else wanted
            to look at meant no one would bother me. If you do the same, you'll
            be able to automate or outsource and set the pace of the
            deliverables and completion, “drawing them out” as needed.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Another great strategy is to find projects outside of your
            team. Automating or outsourcing tasks and projects too close and
            involved with your team can get tricky. Working outside the team
            gives you extra space and independence to run the show and pace your
            way. Remember: The goal is to find projects you can own.
            Volunteering to manage projects outside your team shows initiative.
            It can save the company from having to hire outside help and puts
            you on their good side. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Of course, be sure the project is
            related to your role and that you have the ability to outsource,
            automate, or streamline it in some way. Since it’s outside your
            team, you’ll want to ensure your manager knows you’ll be working on
            it, giving you enough time in the schedule. The goal is to let
            "automatable" or "outsourceable" work take up as much of your duties
            as possible—don’t let the project become an additional project that
            you have to perform on top of your regular workload. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Don’t be
            afraid to leverage your specialized skills, too. Find something no
            one else can do, and make it yours. For example, if you’re working
            as a developer but have a background in design, you have unique
            value only you can offer. Use this to your advantage by finding and
            proposing projects aligned with your unique expertise.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Identify an inefficiency, and propose a solution. This
            instantly makes you the leader of the process. If you develop and
            oversee a project, it can’t run without you. Combine your skills and
            background with automation and outsourcing, and you can create
            opportunities that make you irreplaceable at the company.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Another powerful way to become indispensable at your job is to
            take over or add "business-critical" processes. These are tasks,
            procedures, and projects that are necessary for the business to
            scale its efforts, secure data, maintain profits, and remain
            efficient. Spend the first ninety days identifying these processes,
            and connect your role to them. Pinpoint the core needs and
            challenges of the company, and make your role a part of the
            solution. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>It all ties back to your value: If you can support,
            streamline, or improve these essential processes, you become
            essential to the team. It doesn’t matter how you get it done; it
            just matters that you get it done. As you tether yourself to a
            business-critical process in the first ninety days, it’ll become
            harder to fire you, and people will probably leave you alone.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Make Friends
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Some of the greatest assets you can have to secure your
            employment in the first ninety days are friendships. Gallup research
            shows having a “work best friend” doubles your chance of producing
            high-quality work, experiencing less stress, and achieving a
            positive sense of well-being<sup>79</sup>. Take Microsoft, for
            example. They tested out a “buddy system” for onboarding new hires.
            As a result, they found that ninety-seven percent of employees who
            met with their “buddy” eight or more times in the first ninety days
            were more productive and found their flow faster. This percentage
            decreased the less the buddies met up<sup>80</sup>. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Friends
            make work fun (or at least less miserable). And if you’re reaping
            these benefits of work friendships, you become more valuable to the
            company. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Remember: You want to be established in the company
            by the end of the ninety days. You want them to view you as someone
            who’s already been there for a while—not the "newbie" no one’s heard
            of. Once you establish your presence and value, it's easier to slip
            under the radar without anyone worrying whether or not you’re
            getting your work done. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>It’s easy for managers to fire someone
            they don’t know. If they’re friends, it’s a whole different story.
            The truth is no one likes conflict. Managers rarely fire those they
            have a personal relationship with. If they feel connected to you,
            most managers will have you do nothing for months before getting
            enough courage to talk to you about a performance issue. The more
            people you know and the more people you talk to, the more likely it
            will be that you will be ignored, left alone, or moved around
            instead of fired. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Of course, making friends can be a bit of a
            challenge when you’re working from home. It's easy to get isolated
            and cut off from the social interactions that take place in a
            traditional office environment. With a little effort and the right
            strategies, you can successfully make friends at work in the first
            ninety days. Make an extra effort to connect and network with your
            team:
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Attend virtual events: Even remote companies have their own share
            of virtual events. Join these events and show up with enthusiasm in
            the first ninety days. Get to know your colleagues on a more
            personal level. Use this time to introduce yourself and chat about
            non-work-related topics. This is where you can evolve from a
            “newbie” to a team member and friend. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Join online groups: Many companies have their own internal forums,
            Slack channels, and other virtual spaces where employees can
            interact and build relationships. Get involved: Take advantage of
            these spaces in the first ninety days, and participate in
            conversations whenever you can. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Speak up in meetings: You can’t leave a first impression if no one
            notices you. It’s easy to slip under the radar in a remote setting.
            This is great later down the line—but when you’re establishing
            yourself as a vital asset to the company, you’ll need to speak up
            and plant your roots. Share your thoughts and participate in
            meetings, particularly during the first ninety days. This gives the
            illusion that you’re doing more than you actually are. This is the
            phenomenon called the “babble hypothesis.” Research shows that those
            who talk the most in a group are seen and chosen as the
            leaders<sup>81</sup>. You have to go to the meeting anyway, so you
            might as well get points for it by participating. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Be proactive and reach out: Don't wait for others to initiate
            contact with you. Take the initiative. Reach out to your colleagues,
            introduce yourself, and ask them how their day is going or if
            they’re working on anything interesting. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Share your interests: Remember: People trust those they can relate
            to. When chatting with your colleagues online, weave those common
            threads, interests, and hobbies. Build connections on a more
            personal level, and begin making yourself indispensable. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Offer to help: Show up and volunteer to help in the first ninety
            days, even if the project or task feels small. Use your specialized
            skills (or automation and outsourcing connections), and offer to
            help your colleagues, whether inside or outside your team. Of
            course, keep your overemployment strategies to yourself. Don't
            forget: They're still "work friends." You don’t have to share
            everything about your life. You can still be a great work friend by
            helping them when needed. This can be a great way to build
            relationships and show you’re a valuable team member. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Make networking a part of your routine: Whether checking in on the
            same day and time each week or attending a monthly virtual lunch,
            regular interactions help build familiarity and trust with
            coworkers. This is key to establishing yourself as a part of the
            company.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>It’s all about culture fit. Pretend to be “all in" so your
            first impression lasts. Thanks to the halo effect, it will be
            difficult for coworkers or managers to question your work ethic
            later down the line. A strong first impression will give you a
            lasting benefit of the doubt.

            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Become a Leader for Your Small Team
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>As you establish yourself in the company, work hard, and make
            friends, you pave the path to leadership. If your goal was to rise
            to the top of the ranks in your last job, you’ll need to reframe
            your mindset. Leadership is a paradox. The higher up you go, the
            more control you have over your schedule. However, the higher you
            climb, the more people you oversee, the more office politics you
            have to navigate, and the more responsibilities you have. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>The
            key here is knowing the difference between leading people and
            projects. Leading people takes time, meetings, and conversations;
            leading projects gives you control, flexibility, and clout. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>As
            an individual contributor, you have clear expectations. You work on
            deliverables and checklists. If the job is done, you can pretty much
            clock out. As a manager, the work is never done. You are always a
            leader and responsible for others, even when working on projects.
            You’re more visible, making it difficult to maintain boundaries and
            juggle two or more jobs. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>The truth is that you cannot hold two
            jobs as a manager. As a manager, you'll be pulled into too many
            meetings. You'll be responsible for managing people, which is not
            ideal when trying to balance two jobs. You can’t automate or
            outsource managing others. This requires your dedicated time and
            presence from nine-to-five (or longer). You can either chase
            promotions and leadership positions that increase your salary by
            three percent, or you can settle for two mid-level jobs and double
            income. The choice is yours. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>If you choose the latter, you can
            still strive to be a leader but in a different way. Lead projects,
            not people. Let’s say you’re a software developer. The company’s
            talking about revamping its e-Learning platform to be more
            user-friendly. They need someone to step up and oversee the
            initiative. This is your chance. As a project leader, you can set
            the schedule, pace, and meeting cadence that works best for you.
            Once again, you exhibit leadership skills that solidify your value
            in the company and enjoy more control over your schedule. By taking
            charge of projects, you can make sure that everything is moving
            along smoothly while freeing up your own time. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Don’t forget:
            You’re still in the first ninety days. It’ll take effort to be seen
            as a leader, even if it’s over one project. One way to become a
            leader for your small project team is to get certified in Scrum and
            Agile methodologies. These methodologies are typically used in the
            software development industry but have evolved to work in any
            technology field. These certifications are great resources for
            individuals who want to lead a team efficiently and effectively
            while not actually managing a team. Essentially, Agile and Scrum are
            project management systems: <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Agile focuses more on flexibility
            and leadership-based teams. It’s centered around the idea of putting
            people first. It’s all about continually adapting and staying
            "agile." <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Scrum works best for cross-collaboration and complex
            projects. It’s a bit more structured and rigid, helping keep
            workflows organized<sup>82</sup>. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>You can find free and
            low-cost Agile and Scrum certification courses on platforms like
            SCRUMstudy, Coursera, and Udemy<sup>83</sup>. Studying and passing
            the certification can easily be done over a weekend.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Certification in Agile and Scrum methodologies can instantly
            boost your credibility and trust as a leader. When project planning
            is in the works and they need someone to step up, you can. Let them
            know you’re certified and can apply these methodologies to oversee
            the project, keep it organized, and achieve success. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>To become
            a project leader, it's important to be proactive and engaged in your
            work. Demonstrate a willingness to take on new challenges and
            responsibilities. Seek out opportunities to lead projects or drive
            initiatives. Be willing to take ownership of tasks and processes
            that are business-critical. As you do so, you can establish yourself
            as an irreplaceable team member and gain the respect and trust of
            your colleagues and superiors.

            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Get Used to Your Remote Setup
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>If you can’t tell by now, our goal in overemployment is to be
            known and trusted in the first ninety days so we can eventually be
            trusted and left alone. Being in a remote job is the way to do this.
            Leaving a solid first impression in onboarding a remote job can look
            very different, especially if it’s your first virtual gig. Keep
            these five tips in mind to leave a first impression that reaches
            beyond the screen:
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Set up your remote office: The research is clear: Remote work
            takes less time. This is only true if you know how to navigate the
            company’s software, tools, and processes. From day one, make sure
            you have the correct usernames, passwords, hardware, software, and
            setup to get the work done. Familiarize yourself with their employee
            management and communication systems. Think of this as mapping out
            the virtual office. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Introduce yourself: Want to make friends? Strengthen your network
            and connection to the company by introducing yourself to as many
            people as possible in the first ninety days. It can be a simple
            message introducing yourself, asking how they are or seeing if they
            need any help. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Make virtual eye contact: Use the same remote interview tips for
            video conferencing in meetings. Make eye contact with the camera,
            join calls on time, and work the meeting software like a pro. First
            impression research shows that we find people more trustworthy,
            charismatic, intelligent, and friendly simply because they make good
            eye contact. Show up and look at that camera. Prove that you’re
            confident working from home, and they’ll leave you alone. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Establish a routine: Who you are on the first day can set the tone
            for the next ninety days and beyond. Set boundaries with your
            family, friends, or roommates to keep your space organized and limit
            interruptions. If you’re asynchronous, figure out what times of day
            you’re most productive and establish your schedule. Once you have a
            set routine, it will be easier to incorporate your second job when
            the time comes. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Gauge the expectations: Pay attention to the company's
            communication culture. How do people interact in meetings? What are
            your colleagues' communication preferences? How often do others
            expect you to check in, and how fast do they expect you to complete
            your work? Gauge the overall expectations. While we want to work
            hard and stand out, we don’t want to set expectations that we’re
            fast-paced and eager to take on more and more. Know where, when, and
            how you’re expected to perform.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Make Sure it’s the Right Fit for You, Too
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>These first ninety days aren’t just a test for the company to
            see if you’re the right fit—it’s a test to see if the company aligns
            with your overemployment goals. Don’t be afraid to walk away. I
            worked for a company and left before I hit the two-day mark. It just
            wasn’t the right culture or fit for my goals. It can be a difficult
            decision, but it's important to prioritize your own well-being and
            career goals. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>The first ninety days are essentially a test to
            see if you are who you said you are in your resume and interview.
            For you, it’s a test to see if they deliver on the flexible company
            culture, work-life balance, wellness initiatives, and other traits
            they advertised in the job description. The first few weeks are
            meant for you to learn the ropes and get adjusted. If you find
            yourself swamped with work after a few days of training, it might be
            a sign to run. To help decide if it’s time to make a quick entrance
            and exit, take time to think about why it’s not the right fit. Does
            the culture seem off? Do they have unrealistic time expectations for
            your role? Is management toxic? Sit down and have a conversation
            with your manager to discuss your expectations vs. reality. If the
            position is doing more harm than good, don’t be afraid to move on to
            a new opportunity. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Worried about how it will affect your
            resume? If you don’t put the company on your resume, no one will
            know. Cross it off as practice for the resume, interview, and
            onboarding processes. Quit and move on. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Don’t burn bridges,
            but don’t be afraid to leave toxic places. Be smart about it: If you
            have nothing to fall back on, hit the job search again and hang
            tight until you find a new role. Overemployment is meant to be a
            financial safety net, not a liability. Proceed with caution, be
            respectful, and add any new ‘red flags’ to look out for in your job
            search. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>If the company has some integrity, and you’re finding
            opportunities to take advantage of the system, keep moving forward.
            The journey to overemployment isn’t instant. As you settle in and
            work your way toward two paychecks, it will all pay off. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>In
            the first ninety days, lay down your employer-employee expectations.
            They establish you as an asset to the company: One who cannot be
            replaced. This is your time to leave a first impression that you’re
            a hard worker who gets the job done. From here, it’s time to take
            your forty-hour workweek and whittle it down to under fifteen.

            Corporate America has tricked us into believing one simple equation:
            The more hours you work, the more productive you'll be.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Your boss wants you to get more done, so you work more hours.
            It seems logical, but it completely goes against our psychology.
            Research shows us the numbers don't add up. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>In February 2022,
            thirty-three companies tested out the four-day workweek. This
            experiment was conducted to see if employees could do the same work
            for the same pay but in just eighty percent of the time. After six
            months of the experiment, the majority of the companies experienced
            an increase in revenue, productivity, employee health and
            well-being, and overall engagement. One of the companies doubled its
            profits and productivity in the timeframe<sup>84</sup>. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Now,
            further research shows us this isn't true for everyone: About two in
            three businesses experience an increase in employee productivity by
            cutting down work hours. Those that don't are in primarily
            time-based industries, like twenty-four/seven customer service
            centers, that need to trade their time for money. If you followed
            the steps in Chapter 2, you'll be in the first group: The
            value-based industries. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Of course, we’re not just here to
            shift to a four-day workweek. That’s still thirty-two hours for just
            one job. We’re here to whittle down our workweeks into fifteen
            hours: just under three hours per day. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>As we’ve learned, the
            average American white-collar worker only does productive work for
            two hours and fifty-three minutes per day. The rest is blurred and
            filled in with responding to messages, scrolling on social media,
            reading the news, or even looking for new jobs. One study shows the
            average worker wastes one hour reading the news, forty-four minutes
            on social media, forty minutes socializing, twenty-six minutes job
            hunting, and twenty-three minutes taking breaks<sup>85</sup>.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>This isn’t just laziness. It’s how we cope with the eight-hour
            workday to keep our brains functioning. You see, our brains aren't
            wired to focus for that long. The studies vary, but the verdict is
            clear: We are physically incapable of dedicating one hundred percent
            of our focus to a task for eight hours straight<sup>86</sup>.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>It doesn’t end here. After a few hours, our productivity
            pretty much begins to flatline. It’s an age-old phenomenon: If we're
            given thirty minutes to complete a small task, it will take us
            thirty minutes—but if we're given an hour to complete the same task,
            we'll find a way to use the entire hour. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>When we work too
            long, our brains get desperate for change, stimulation, and
            dopamine. We crave procrastination, finding an excuse to take a
            break to stretch our legs and stimulate our minds. Yet
            procrastination isn’t laziness—it’s an emotional
            response<sup>87</sup>. It is a way to avoid difficult or
            uncomfortable emotions like frustration, exhaustion, or boredom.
            When we're burnt out, our brains run empty, searching for
            distractions as a way to recharge. In the end, we're caught in an
            endless loop of burnout<sup>88</sup>. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>If we cut down the fluff
            and get right to the work, we reduce the need for these distractions
            and breaks. Which is exactly why studies show employees working
            four-day workweeks get the same amount of work done and are even
            more productive in some cases. If procrastination is heavily driven
            by our moods, then so is productivity. If we’re more rested, we can
            be more productive. Finding the motivation to continue is easier
            when we actually have the energy. As a result, we’re less driven to
            find distractions to fill our time. We don't have to "buy back" our
            free time, as we actually have the time to scroll, relax, and enjoy
            our "filler time" outside of work. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>This filler time keeps us
            busy––or at least it makes us look like we're busy. When you work in
            an office, you have to look busy, even when you aren't. It's
            difficult to shake this habit when transitioning from the office to
            remote work. Instead of hanging out by the water cooler, we waste
            time talking in chat rooms or scrolling on Reddit. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Once you
            get comfortable in your job, you’ll find yourself in the same
            pattern. When this happens, you'll know you're in a great spot to
            start planning for multiple jobs. To make this work, you'll need to
            change how you approach your daily to-dos. Let's cut down your hours
            now so you have free time to enjoy yourself or start applying for
            your next job. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>As you filter out the busy work and isolate the
            productive work, you can eliminate those five hours of filler time.
            With the right strategies, you can lower your workload, stabilize
            your efforts, and set a slow, sustainable pace for your workflow.

            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Once you graduate from your first ninety-day sprint, you'll
            quickly settle right into the patterns that most workers follow
            every day: two to three hours of actual, legitimate work and six
            hours of wasting time. Our goal is to isolate these two to three
            hours, cross them off our list, and move on. This takes a bit of
            skill and strategy, but with the right systems, you can make it
            happen. To start, you just need to follow two simple steps:
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Step 1: Become aware of your core tasks.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Identify what you actually need to do, and isolate those
            tasks. Here's an example: Let’s look at the average workday of a UX
            designer. Like many techies and creatives, there are four main types
            of tasks in the day: Research, brainstorming, designing, and
            communicating. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>About half of the day is spent developing,
            researching, and thinking about ideas. It’s playing "catching up,"
            reading through feedback, and organizing ideas. This shouldn’t take
            three to four hours—but it does for many designers and
            professionals. This is because it's easy to get distracted from
            these tasks. When we “catch up” in meetings, it's easy to spend half
            the time talking about your weekend or complaining about your job
            (if your boss isn’t on the call). We watch YouTube videos, read
            articles, and scroll through websites for inspiration. While this
            ideation process is necessary, it’s perfectly positioned for
            distractions. With just one wrong click, you can fall down an
            internet rabbit hole. It’s a slippery slope. The key here is to
            speed up your research and brainstorming processes. Approach them
            like a focused, actionable task rather than a background,
            "autopilot" task. Give yourself a set timeframe to make a plan, not
            just find inspiration. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>In this example, design work should
            make up the bulk of the productive hours. If you talk to most UX
            designers, you’ll find they spend most of their time on research,
            collaboration, and ideation, and just a short one to three-hour
            window actually doing design work89 90 <sup>91</sup>. This is your
            focused work. As a UX designer, this is the value you’re paid to
            bring. This is your core task. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Too many professionals in
            value-based roles spend five or more hours preparing for and
            discussing what you did in those one to three hours. Cut those five
            hours down, and you’ll be on your way to a fifteen-hour workweek.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Now, this isn’t just about UX designers. This is just an
            example, but it rings true for most value jobs. The key is to
            identify your types of tasks, isolate the core tasks, and optimize
            the rest. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Start by tracking your schedule and productivity
            levels over the course of one to two typical workweeks. Figure out
            what you actually do and get done each day. Calculate the time you
            spend on each task, and group your tasks into categories and
            priorities. Self-awareness is the key here. If everyone realized
            they only needed two to three hours to finish their work, they
            would. If it was easy, everyone would do it. Be aggressive, and
            track your time, tasks, and productivity to identify your must-haves
            and time-wasters. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Your must-haves are your core tasks. They’re
            the tasks that will give you trouble if you don’t finish them by the
            end of the day. Most often, these are formal tasks your manager
            assigns you or tasks related to projects you’ve promised to deliver.
            They’re deliverables you can send and tangible projects you can
            cross off your list, like “write a thousand-word blog,” “schedule
            client’s social media posts,” or “submit data analytics report.” At
            the end of the day, these are pretty much the only tasks that
            matter. By spending all your time and energy on these tasks, you not
            only waste less time but bring more value. You dedicate your
            knowledge and skills to the tasks you were hired for. As a
            result—you can do a better job and work less. Time management is all
            about knowing your priorities.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Step 2: Weed out your time-wasters and low-priority tasks.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>You’ll know if a task isn't essential if you can push it to
            the next day, week, or month with minimal consequences. These tasks
            typically don’t have rigid deadlines. No one’s waiting on you to
            complete them. They might not be on your formal to-do list at all.
            These are normally tasks like optional meetings, emails, and
            reporting. You still need to do them; you just need to spend less
            time doing them. These tasks can easily be automated or outsourced
            (which we’ll dive into in Chapter 7). <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Your time-wasters might
            not even be to-dos at all. They can be distractions that evolve into
            habits, sneaking into your workweek and consuming all your time.
            This includes scrolling on social media, chatting with coworkers,
            reading articles, or watching videos. Even though these don’t feel
            like working, because they are during work hours, your brain feels
            like you are working. When the clock strikes five, you’ll feel
            exhausted, even if you spent five of your eight hours on
            time-wasters. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>You see, technology is a double-edged sword.
            Computers have improved efficiency well beyond the pace of
            business—but they’ve also made it a lot easier to waste time. As I
            said, research and brainstorming can easily turn into mindless
            scrolling if you’re not careful. Use computers to improve your
            efficiency. Try to avoid wasting your "work hours" by sneaking in
            busy work and distractions. By using every minute of your three
            hours for productive, hands-on work, you’ll eventually create the
            shortest possible workday. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>And as you do so, you’ll find your
            strengths. Research shows our energy levels increase when working on
            something we’re good at<sup>92</sup>. Remember: Procrastination and
            distractions are coping mechanisms for avoiding emotions. We’ll
            always find ways to waste more time if we don’t see the value we
            bring. By focusing all your energy on your core tasks, you'll become
            better at your craft. And as a result? You’ll spend the bulk of your
            time working on what you’re good at, all while increasing your
            energy levels. Instead of entering the endless loop of burnout and
            distractions, you’ll enter a loop of improvement and productivity.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Of course, this requires us to escape the old loop. Don’t fall
            into old habits and waste your time. As you get comfortable in your
            job, take it as a sign to ramp up and sharpen your productivity to
            create space for your next job. Keep these strategies in mind to
            break free from the eight-hour workday habits ingrained in your
            system: <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Don’t pretend to be busy. Only be working or not
            working: don’t leave room for anything in between. You’re working
            from home—no one’s watching you. Instead of trying to look like
            you’re busy while waiting for your next task, mentally clock out.
            Leave the room if you need to. Make it a habit to be done and move
            on. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Stop multitasking. It’s easy to want to make remote work
            feel less like work by working on the couch, playing your favorite
            mindless sitcom in the background, and scrolling on your phone in
            between tasks. This is an effort to take more control over your
            time. But the truth is, it only makes you lose it. Multitasking only
            multiplies the amount of time each task takes you to complete.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>If you think you’re a good multi-tasker, think again. Research
            has shown time after time that multitasking is
            impossible<sup>93</sup>. Instead of juggling multiple tasks at once,
            our minds quickly switch back and forth from task to task. This
            drains much more energy from our brains than focusing on one task
            would. It also lowers our performance, making us deliver less value
            per task. In fact, we lost five to fifteen percent of our cognitive
            efficiency while multitasking<sup>94</sup>. Not only are we getting
            less done, but we’re exhausting more of our focus and concentration.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Don’t browse online. Your company will love this one, too.
            Don’t blend your free time and work time. Dedicate your time solely
            to your core tasks by limiting your main distraction: Your phone and
            personal tabs. Put your phone on silent, in “do not disturb” mode,
            or in the other room if needed. Block personal notifications and
            apps on your phone and computer during work hours. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Don’t "task
            jump." Dedicate time to work on one task at a time. Jumping back and
            forth between tasks will leave you with a few unfinished tasks and
            nothing to show for it. Truly, productivity comes down to how we
            organize our workdays.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Develop Your Three-Hour Workday Routine
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>There’s no greater feeling than finishing your work a few
            hours early. You sneak out, keeping your notifications on in case
            someone needs you, and finally breathe a sigh of relief. This can be
            your reality every day if you create the right routine. Turning a
            full-time job into a part-time job takes strategy and systems.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Remember: Overemployment isn’t doing half the work. Don’t be
            an average worker. You can get everything done, stay organized, and
            condense your workday into the shortest amount of time possible, all
            while still being the most valuable person on the team. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Begin
            organizing your workday by setting your "focus hours. You’ll need a
            solid grasp of what’s expected of you to do this. In the best-case
            scenario, you’ll find an asynchronous job where you can work any
            time of day you choose. If not, that’s okay. Build your day around
            any mandatory meetings or routine check-ins. If you have a 9 a.m.
            meeting, set your focus hours from 6 to 6 a.m. or 10 to 1 p.m.,
            depending on whether or not you’re a morning person. If you hit the
            jackpot and don’t have too many meetings, note any routine
            check-ins: Does your manager tend to check in at a certain time of
            day? Does your team collaborate or communicate more during the
            morning or afternoon? Take note of this and set your hours
            accordingly. Just don't set them during the middle of this time, as
            the communication will distract you. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Meetings and the time
            between meetings are major time-wasters. If you shuffle your focus
            hours, you can use this downtime to take care of errands and
            personal tasks, freeing up your time in the long run. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>If you
            have flexibility around setting your focus hours, make the most of
            your unique "internal clock." When tracking your typical schedule
            for one to two weeks, pay attention to the times of day you’re most
            productive. We all have our own internal clocks known as "circadian
            rhythms." These are the physical, mental, and emotional changes we
            routinely experience each day. It’s the reason you're typically
            hungry, tired, or energized at the same time each day<sup>95</sup>.
            We all run on our own time. Instead of forcing yourself to be a
            morning person or cramming in work during your afternoon slump, lean
            into your productive hours. Research suggests we experience three
            productivity phases each day: Peak, trough, and rebound. We’re most
            productive during and before our peak hours. We drop in focus during
            our trough hours and rise back up during rebound as we see the light
            at the end of the tunnel (or workday)<sup>96</sup>. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>For most
            of the population, this cycle goes as follows: Our peak falls
            between morning to noon, our trough drops in the afternoon, and we
            rebound as we get ready to clock out and begin the rest of our day.
            However, this cycle can start at different times, especially for our
            early birds and night owls. Analyze your peak, trough, and rebound,
            and plan your schedule accordingly. While working one job, you can
            optimize your schedule to only work during your focus hours and
            avoid the trough entirely. As you stack on your second job, you can
            still plan your schedule to maximize productivity. With this in
            mind, there are a few different ways you can approach your schedule.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Work on your core tasks during peak hours for the most
            productive and fastest results. Take care of busy work during your
            trough, as it's lower priority. This ensures you complete your core
            tasks and move on without much stress. Lastly, brainstorm or
            collaborate during your rebound hours, as you’ll be in the best
            mood. This aligns most with overemployment. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>If you waste too
            much time on busy work and enjoy your core tasks, flip it: Cross off
            your busy work by speeding through them during peak hours. This will
            help you avoid getting distracted and drawing them out. Then, work
            on your core tasks during your trough, as you’re more motivated to
            get them done than your busy work. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Try out both approaches and
            see what works best for you. The reason most productivity hacks
            don’t work is because they’re too generalized. There's not one
            hidden secret to productivity, but by identifying your core tasks
            and time-wasters, mapping out your most and least productive hours,
            and experimenting with your schedule, you can see what works best
            for you as you turn eight hours into two to three hours. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Now
            that you know your most productive hours, you must learn to make the
            most of them. We want to enter “hyperfocus" or our “flow states”: A
            state where you're completely concentrated and immersed in a task.
            We don't want to run on autopilot here. Your focus hours should be
            strategic and intentional. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>The average worker spends
            twenty-eight percent of their day reading and replying to emails.
            That’s just one distraction. A large-scale McKinsey study found that
            we’re distracted from work every ten minutes—that’s fifty-six times
            per day<sup>97</sup>. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Here’s the real kicker: It takes about
            twenty-five minutes to regain our full concentration on a task after
            a distraction. That means we lose about two hours simply trying to
            re-find our flow each day. Every little 'ding' and disruption can
            damage our pace and reset our productivity levels. If we can cut
            down the distractions and stay focused, we gain more momentum and
            lose less time. That’s where time-blocking comes in.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Time-blocking is the practice of scheduling time for focused,
            uninterrupted work on your core tasks. There are five main steps to
            time-blocking:
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Step 1: List all the tasks you have to do.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>I recommend making this a daily habit. At the start of your
            day, list everything that needs to get done.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Step 2: Prioritize your list.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Arrange your list in order from most important to least
            important. Identify the tasks you must accomplish (your core tasks)
            vs. items you can push off later. Choose your most important tasks
            and worry less about the rest.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Step 3: Block out time in your schedule.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Estimate how long it will take to complete each core task. It
            doesn’t have to be an exact number. As you track your schedule for
            one to two weeks, you’ll get a rough idea of how long you’ll need
            for routine tasks. Keep tabs on your productivity even after this
            timeframe so your estimates get more accurate over time. Regardless,
            the time scheduled for each task should be solely dedicated to that
            task: No checking emails, phones, or working on other small projects
            in between.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Step 4: Leave room for flexibility.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Add time to your schedule for miscellaneous tasks, busy work,
            and unexpected events. These are your unplanned check-ins, meetings,
            or personal emergencies. Leave room for life to happen.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Step 5: Make it happen.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Turn off notifications, use your noise-canceling headphones,
            and close the door. This is your time to get your core tasks
            done<sup>98</sup>.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Ironically, planning can be one of your biggest time-savers or
            time-wasters. Plan to make your schedule more organized. Don’t waste
            time perfecting your plan as a way to procrastinate actually doing
            the work. Set a time limit for how long you can plan your day, and
            move on. As you dedicate time to your most important tasks, you can
            get the job done and increase the value of your work.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Set the Pace as the Project Leader
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>As you master the art of planning your daily routine and
            delivering your value on a daily basis, you can also start planning
            over the long term. If you followed the advice from Chapter 5, you
            should have several processes or projects that you own and allow you
            to set the pace for. Once they’re established, they just need
            maintenance. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Here, you’ll shift from the ninety-day sprint to
            ‘maintenance mode.’ Your first impression laid the groundwork. Now,
            the halo effect will carry on, even as you take small steps back.
            This doesn’t mean you’ll suddenly stop delivering quality work.
            Instead, you will simply settle into a routine once you develop
            projects and establish their flows. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>As a member of the
            overemployment club, you’ll learn to love routines. Routines help
            you know exactly what to expect. With this clarity and structure,
            you can simplify your workflow equation, reducing your hours with
            the help of time-blocking, automation, and outsourcing.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Slow & Steady Wins the Race
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Reducing eight hours of work into three hours of work is just
            the first step. If you aren’t careful, this strategy can double or
            even triple the amount of work you do. Get your work done quickly
            during your focus hours. But remember: Do your work quickly, but
            don't deliver your work quickly. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>If you deliver work too fast,
            you'll be given more work. It seems backward: If you’re better and
            faster at your job, you’re rewarded (re: punished) with more work.
            To cap your work at two to three hours, you’ll need to master the
            art of timing. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Try to get your timing down to deliver things
            just fast enough for people not to hassle you or take notice. Much
            of this comes with understanding the pace of the business: A key
            strategy we discussed in Chapter <sup>5</sup>. Truth be told, most
            white-collar businesses are incredibly slow-paced. We’re not dealing
            with life-or-death situations; we typically deal with data,
            marketing, and websites. If most businesses were as fast paced as
            they claim, the average productivity time for workers wouldn’t be
            two hours and fifty-three minutes. As you adjust to the company,
            seek an accurate picture of the average pace and flow. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>You
            see, most employees spend the other four and a half hours of the day
            pretending to be busy. If you start delivering too quickly, you'll
            have to start creating extra work for yourself to look like you’re
            busy, too. Get your work done, but don’t tell anyone. Don't share or
            publish it until you need to. This doesn’t mean you should submit
            projects or tasks late: A good frame of reference is to be just a
            little better than an average coworker. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Let’s say you complete
            a project two weeks ahead of time. You automated eighty percent of
            it, and it’s sitting in your files, waiting to be submitted. If the
            project is high-priority, don’t be afraid to submit it a day or two
            ahead of time. You’ll still be buying yourself time while saving
            your company time: Once again, it’s a win-win. If it’s a
            low-priority project, hold off until it’s due to give yourself some
            extra free time. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Overall, don't be afraid to purposefully slow
            things down. Deadlines can give us anxiety, making everything feel
            like a high-priority task. A bit of careful planning and
            prioritizing each day can help bring you back down to Earth.
            Remember: Not everything is an emergency. Not every deadline is
            firm. Know what the company expects of you, and adjust your timing
            accordingly. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Make it your prerogative to purposefully slow
            processes and projects down when possible. If you have to ask
            someone a question, schedule a meeting for tomorrow or even a few
            days later. If something seems complicated, you can drag out the
            work longer because no one else will want to look into it. This is
            another great perk of being a project leader. It’s much easier to
            drag out timelines and due dates when you’re in charge of the
            progress. No one will care if the work is:
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Not business-critical. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Something no one wants to do. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Complicated. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • All of the above.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Approach tasks and projects methodically. Your greatest skill
            in the overemployment world is your ability to prioritize. As you
            sharpen this skill, you’ll learn how to pinpoint your time-wasters:
            The less essential “busy” work at the bottom of your to-do list.
            Now, I know I said not to waste any time here—and you shouldn’t,
            actually. Just be sure to give yourself as much time as you need
            when delivering non-essential busy work. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Overall, work quickly
            but don’t rush your timelines. Encourage other team members to give
            the work the time it deserves. If you follow the steps in this book,
            you’ll likely establish your reputation as someone who puts value
            over time, quality over quantity. You’re not just looking to clock
            in and out—you want to focus on what’s most important and dedicate
            your time to it. This means you aren’t afraid to give projects the
            time they need or delay projects that aren’t important. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>As a
            project leader, you can set the project's tone, culture, and goal to
            prioritize quality over speed. Encourage others to deliver on value,
            not just deadlines. This will free up your schedule and help filter
            your workday into a two to three hour window. Plus, you’ll be known
            as a project leader who drives quality and results, opening up more
            opportunities to continue leading and developing projects you get to
            schedule and control.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Setting Boundaries with Communication
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>I’ll spare you another statistic about how much time we waste
            on emails and messages. While communication is essential, it’s our
            biggest time-waster. It disrupts our flow and prevents us from
            entering and staying in focus mode. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Set precedence for being
            slower to respond. Let people know that you focus on maintaining a
            zero-inbox workflow but only check your emails once a day.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Don’t establish the reputation that you’re lazy or bad at
            responding. Frame your reputation the right way. Let your coworkers
            know you’ll be in “focus mode” during certain hours of the day. This
            is true. You’re not slow to respond because you’re just spacey or
            disorganized—you’re taking care of the most important projects
            first. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>You can limit disruptions by scheduling time to check
            your email at the beginning and end of each day. Share your
            communication preferences and boundaries with coworkers. Let them
            know when they can reach you. Learn how quickly you’re expected to
            respond via chat platforms like Slack. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Strategically send
            messages through the right channel: Email should be used for
            anything you don’t need (or want) a reply to immediately. Chat
            platforms should be used for anything you need a response to within
            the hour, and text should only be used for emergencies. Honestly,
            it’s the same for everyone else, too: If someone emails you, it
            probably means they don’t need or even want an instant reply.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Share your communication preferences and boundaries with
            coworkers. Let them know the best times to reach you. If your
            coworkers know you’ll be busy during certain hours, they’ll wait to
            contact you unless it’s an emergency. Many platforms like Slack
            allow you to put a “status” next to your name or profile. Utilize
            these to your advantage, updating them to show the team that you’re
            in “focus mode.” <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>In the end, it all comes down to prioritizing
            your core tasks and setting boundaries with your team. Work doesn’t
            have to know everything about your life. In the pursuit of
            overemployment, you’re bound to miss a few messages, meetings, or
            deadlines. Do your absolute best not to get into those situations,
            but set up a good backstory for when that happens. Now, you don't
            have to lie: But know that you aren’t obligated to share every
            detail of your life with your coworkers. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Work-life balance
            requires work-life boundaries. Don’t over-explain yourself to
            people. Plan ahead: Get ahead of moving meetings and establish
            boundaries early on. This will make it easier when you actually have
            to uphold these boundaries with two or more jobs. We’ll explore the
            tools you need to continue shortening workdays in our next chapter.

          <h2>Seven: Outsource and Automate</h2>
          <p>
            TL; DR ( Too Long; Didn’t Read ) <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>—— <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Automate and outsource tasks that are repetitive, inefficient, and
            don’t require your hands-on expertise. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Identify opportunities to improve processes by taking over tasks
            or projects that can be simplified. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • There are two types of automation systems available—no-code and
            code-driven. Use the one that matches your skillset. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Hire an automation expert to identify and implement streamlined
            processes. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Outsource “Start and Finish” tasks: Initial project research, idea
            boards, first drafts, as well as quality assurance, editing, and
            finalizing. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Follow the 80/20 rule to decide what to outsource. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Consider hiring a virtual assistant for administrative tasks like
            communication, data entry, and reports.

            We’ve all seen the movie: Robots take over the world; technology
            advances, eventually outsmarting humans, artificial intelligence
            goes from "self-learning" to "self-aware."
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>White-collar professionals in nearly every industry are
            terrified about automation taking over their jobs. But what if this
            isn't such a bad thing? <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>It took years for many companies to
            adapt to and accept computers, smartphones, and current technology.
            Many companies are still transitioning from outdated, traditional
            processes to smart, technology-driven solutions. As fast as
            technology advances, corporations are still slow to adapt. If you
            embrace the technology in front of you, you can use automation and
            outsourcing to your advantage. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Let's look at the stats: A
            McKinsey Global Institute report estimated that up to half of the
            jobs in the world have the potential to be automated<sup>99</sup>.
            Even more, Goldman Sachs research theorized that automation could
            affect three hundred million jobs. Specifically, they found one in
            every four jobs could be almost completely automated, and two-thirds
            of all jobs could be automated to a certain extent—around
            twenty-five to fifty percent of each role's daily tasks. They
            predict that the administrative, legal, architecture, and
            engineering fields will be the most affected. In contrast, the least
            affected roles will be blue-collar jobs like construction, repair,
            cleaning, and maintenance<sup>100</sup>. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>At first glance, this
            feels bleak. And if you don’t make any changes, it can be.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>With just a few mindset shifts, these advancements can work in
            your favor, because really, we're still just exploring the beginning
            of AI and automation technology. In fact, most professionals are
            resisting it. They’re afraid of it—or they simply don’t understand
            it. If you lean into its potential, the possibilities can and will
            open up. No matter how great technology becomes, people are still
            needed to operate that technology. People are still needed to
            develop, manage, and refine AI and automation. Which is exactly why
            experts believe AI will also create more jobs—over ninety-seven
            million, to be exact101 <sup>102</sup>. The world is shifting, and
            with the right strategy, you can use it to your advantage. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>But
            right now, your goal with automation is simple: Get as much work
            done in as little time as possible. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Automate the mundane,
            repetitive busy work, and prioritize the work that needs your human
            touch. Automate or outsource everything you can so you can focus
            your energy on the value only you can offer. Outsource tasks that
            consume your time but don’t actually need your time. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>As you
            get this practice down, you’ll essentially become the “middleman.”
            You’ll contribute to the gig economy, selling other people's value
            to bolster your free time and theirs. Automation and outsourcing
            aren’t theft, they are simply tools that pave a smarter way to gain
            more free time and make yourself more valuable. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>It’s also
            important to remember: Work takes work. You'll need to work to
            automate, outsource, and pawn off all the small tasks that consume
            your time to make everything else a breeze. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>At this point, you
            should still just be working one job. Once you systemize and
            optimize your workflow, the opportunities for overemployment will
            become clear. By learning to recognize time-saving opportunities,
            automate processes, and delegate tasks, you can enhance your value,
            increase efficiency, and ultimately gain more free time to pursue
            what truly matters to you. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>First: You need to know what you
            can outsource and automate and how.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Identify Your Opportunities to Work Smarter, Not Harder
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>You need a solid foundation and strategic systems to succeed
            in overemployment—and automation and outsourcing will make this
            possible. As you dive into your new role, look for every possible
            opportunity to improve processes or automate tasks. Don't forget:
            People don't know what they don't know. They don't know what they
            can automate or outsource. Your ability to identify these
            opportunities will keep you one step ahead. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>This is all a part
            of your ninety-day onboarding process. Be on the lookout for
            neglected business processes that can be streamlined or simplified.
            Search for repetitive, mundane, or simple tasks: Busy work that can
            easily be automated or outsourced. In general, marketing,
            communication, administrative, financial, data, and analytics tasks
            are easy to automate. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>To help you get started, here are some
            ideas of simple tasks you can automate or outsource:
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Communication: Automate email reminders, invoices, and follow-ups.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Publishing and submittals: Schedule social media posts, blogs,
            file uploads, and report submittals. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Analytics: Set up automatic analytics tracking and reports for
            websites, apps, and social media accounts<sup>103</sup>. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Data management and entry: Automate tasks such as backing up data,
            filling in forms, consolidating data for analytics and reports,
            syncing or transferring data across apps, and converting emails into
            docs, forms into records, etc<sup>104</sup>.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>This is just a scratch on the surface of the tasks you can
            automate or outsource. If you have a skill set that could improve or
            speed up a particular process, take the initiative to take it over.
            Use your previous experience, knowledge, and expertise to take on
            large projects that you know can be simplified: If you can already
            think of several ways to automate or simplify a process or project,
            it's a perfect candidate. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Finding tasks to outsource or
            automate in your nine-to-five job can revolutionize your
            productivity and free up valuable time for more important work. Here
            are a few simple yet strategic methods for identifying such tasks:
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Task Assessment: Begin by assessing your daily tasks and
            responsibilities. Look for tasks that are repetitive,
            time-consuming, low-value, or outside your core expertise. These are
            ideal candidates for outsourcing or automation. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Efficiency Analysis: Evaluate if there are existing tools,
            software, or technologies that can help automate these processes.
            Research popular automation platforms or consult with experts to
            explore options. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Cost-Benefit Analysis: Make sure the effort is worth it. Calculate
            the potential time and cost savings against the expenses of hiring a
            contractor or implementing automation. Approach it as a financial
            and time-based investment, looking at the long-term benefits. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Prioritization: Prioritize tasks based on their potential impact
            on your productivity and overall job performance. Focus on tasks
            that directly contribute to your key responsibilities or require
            specialized expertise. This will help ensure your efforts are
            directed toward the most impactful areas. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Proof of Concept: Test it out. Try outsourcing or automation
            solutions on a smaller scale before fully committing. Pilot projects
            or trials can help you determine if it's worth it. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Continuous Improvement: Regularly review and refine your
            outsourcing or automation strategies. Technology is always
            improving, which means there's always a faster or better way of
            doing things.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>This last strategy should guide your mindset as you strive for
            overemployment because it's true: There's always room to optimize
            and improve. This is the exact reason why there are so many techies
            in the overemployment world; they know these opportunities. It’s
            their job to find ways and create solutions to make processes
            faster, easier, and better. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>As you adopt this mindset and
            improve processes, tread lightly. Soon enough, you'll come face to
            face with one of the key differences between traditional employment
            and overemployment: Taking credit. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>When you commit all your
            time, energy, and career to one company, you find every opportunity
            you can to take credit. You want to prove to them that you belong
            there. That you will grow with them. In return, they might notice
            you, rewarding you with small bonuses and raises (that still lag a
            few laps behind the inflation rate). <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>In overemployment, you’re
            not going to take as much credit. You're going to keep most of these
            improvements to yourself, when it makes sense. It will take a bit of
            humility, but it will all be rewarded, as you get more time and less
            work. If you have significantly improved a process or workflow, keep
            it to yourself. Think of it as getting paid in more time for the
            value you bring to the table. Think of discreetly getting a project
            done faster as an actual bonus. You essentially get paid less for
            your time when you deliver faster because you get the same pay for
            the day, even when you go above and beyond. When you do go the extra
            mile, your pay vs. productivity rate depreciates. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Instead,
            take matters into your own hands. Keep all your gains as personal
            time savers, and never share improvements with the company. Reward
            yourself for your hard work and speed. If you get paid for eight
            hours of work that you completed in three, you have just bumped your
            hourly pay and received the bonus you should have gotten anyway.
            Congrats!

            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Automate Everything You Can: No-Code Solutions
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>We’ll start multiplying your value and subtracting your time
            using automation. Automation isn’t just a cheat code. It’s not just
            a way to do less work— it’s a way to increase efficiency. The
            numbers speak for themselves: <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Over one-third of small
            businesses use automation to reduce errors. Two-thirds of knowledge
            workers use automation to increase productivity and reduce stress.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>You see, automation increases our accuracy, productivity, and
            workplace well-being. Not using automation when possible only wastes
            resources. For example, HR managers—whose tasks are highly
            administrative—waste an average of fourteen hours per week on tasks
            that could otherwise be automated<sup>105</sup>. Automation allows
            us to make the most of the time we have, cutting down on wasted
            time, energy, and resources. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>There are two main types of
            automation: No-code and code automation. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Your no-code
            automation tools are solutions and tools that don’t require coding
            knowledge or experience. If you master some of these tools, you'll
            save yourself years of manual labor. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>One of my favorite tools
            is IfThisThenThat (IFTTT)<sup>106</sup>. There are endless
            automation tools you can use to work smarter, but this one connects
            them all, acting as a personal assistant and project manager all in
            one. IFTTT is an online tool that connects all your apps and
            devices, making automating various processes and tasks easier. It
            works based on a simple principle: A corresponding action is
            triggered if a specific event occurs. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>For example, you can set
            it up so that it watches your calendar for an upcoming meeting. From
            there, it can send you a text reminder before it starts, start
            recording on a smart device during the meeting, listen for keywords
            that will create a task item for you, transcribe the call's audio
            into text, send it to ChatGPT to turn it into bullet points, and
            email that bullet list to yourself. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>That’s just one example of
            what it can do. I could write an entire book on the potential of
            IFTTT, but that's not the point—the point is, IFTTT can make your
            job easier. Once you sign up, you can access a wide range of
            pre-built automation templates called "applets." These applets cover
            various services and devices, including workspace apps, social media
            platforms, smart home devices, email providers, and more. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>To
            get started, browse the available applets and select the ones that
            align with your needs. For example, you can set up an applet that
            automatically logs your meetings in a Google Spreadsheet or tracks
            your work hours in a private Outlook calendar. You can use it to
            automate your email inbox, setting up rules that categorize and
            prioritize messages. You can even integrate your calendar with task
            management tools to create automated to-do lists<sup>107</sup>. The
            possibilities are endless. With a little strategy, you can automate
            mundane tasks and focus your time and energy on more meaningful
            work. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Another secret productivity weapon is plug-ins or
            add-ons. Most mainstream workplace apps like Google Workspace,
            Microsoft 365, and even Trello, Asana, and Slack have plug-ins and
            add-ons you can integrate for faster, automated workflows. Here are
            some of the highlights:
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Google Workspaces has an entire add-on library most people don’t
            even know exists. You can install these apps and extensions in the
            Google Workspace Marketplace. Some of the tools are made by Google,
            while others are third-party apps. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Boomerang for Gmail allows you to schedule emails, set email
            reminders, and even delay the receipt of incoming emails so you only
            see them when convenient<sup>108</sup>. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Doc Builder for Google Docs lets you turn your documents into
            templates to make reports and routine documents
            faster<sup>109</sup>. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • The Google Analytics Spreadsheet add-on lets you use custom
            calculations, create visual dashboards, and schedule automated data
            reports<sup>110</sup>. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Form Publisher can automatically turn Google Forms or Sheets into
            PDFs, Google Docs, or Office documents<sup>111</sup>. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Trello for Gmail can automatically turn your emails into tasks
            from your messages<sup>112</sup>. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • If your company works out of Asana, you can use Asana for Gmail to
            turn emails into tasks<sup>113</sup>. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • GPT for Sheets and Docs lets you use ChatGPT directly in Google
            Sheets and Docs for writing, summarizing, and
            outlining<sup>114</sup>. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • SlidesAI.io can convert text into designed Google
            Slides<sup>115</sup>.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • writi.io: AI ChatGPT helps you draft emails faster using
            ChatGPT<sup>116</sup>.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>These are just a few of the many add-ons available through the
            Google Workspace Marketplace. Some are free, while others have
            associated costs. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>If your company operates with Microsoft,
            don't worry. They offer many of the same or similar add-ons called
            "add-ins" through their platforms. You can find them by browsing the
            Microsoft AppSource site. They have several categories of add-ins
            you can choose from, including AI and Machine Learning, Analytics,
            Marketing, and Productivity<sup>117</sup>. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>In March 2023,
            Microsoft also launched a tool called Microsoft Copilot, integrating
            generative AI throughout its main apps. By activating the Copilot
            icon in the apps, you can use generative AI to help you write and
            edit documents in Word, automatically design presentations in
            PowerPoint, and analyze and turn data into visuals in Excel. It can
            even help you quick-draft replies and summarize long emails in
            Outlook, take meeting notes and interpret action items in Teams, and
            more<sup>118</sup>. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>In any role where you need to analyze,
            manage, or interpret data, one of the most helpful tools you can
            master is Excel. You can become an Excel Jedi in a matter of weeks.
            Using add-ins or Copilot can streamline this process. Gaining this
            proficiency can open the door to generating documents and reports
            that take most people weeks in only a few seconds. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Your
            ability to use your technology to its fullest potential is essential
            to overemployment. Leaning into automation and AI tools can
            transform the way you work. Members of the overemployment community
            said it themselves in an interview with Vice News: One marketer said
            it does eighty percent of their job. Another admitted that it now
            takes them forty-five minutes to complete a task that used to take
            three hours. One tech professional said ChatGPT is the reason they
            were able to go from two jobs to four<sup>119</sup>. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>AI is not
            a replacement yet. For many professionals, it’s like having a first
            draft done for them. It can process information faster, summarize
            their work, generate performance goals, and turn their bullet-point
            ideas into full-fledged paragraphs, documents, and emails. Some
            programmers and developers use it as a first draft for code: They
            choose their programming language, give it a prompt, and refine the
            output. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>While ChatGPT is the most famous AI tool, it’s not the
            only one. For example, SourceAI and CodePal are great assistants for
            coders. And that's exactly what technology is: A smart assistant for
            your work. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Long story short: The tools are out there—you just
            need to learn how to use them. If you don’t know how to use your
            tools, they’ll end up wasting your time instead of saving it. Great
            example: Your boss who just spent ten minutes figuring out how to
            save a document as a PDF instead of a Word Doc. Don't be like them.
            Embrace the latest technology, and start building out your
            overemployment toolkit.

            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Automate Everything You Can: Code Solutions
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Want to turn automation up a notch? Learn basic code. Code
            automation will drastically improve your ability to automate
            processes. The basics of web coding are relatively easy to get
            familiar with, especially HTML, which is the building block of all
            web pages. You can easily find free online courses and even YouTube
            videos to teach you the basics of HTML. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>This will give you a
            jumping-off point to extract data from a webpage. This is one of the
            most fundamental building blocks of code automation. Entire
            industries, like data entry and billing, are dependent on people who
            do nothing but scrape data from one place to another. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>I once
            worked with a colleague in a billing department. Their job was
            simple: Take an Excel file of payments and enter them into another
            system. That was it. It was a $70k job in an accounting department,
            nine-to-five all year, just entering in payments. With just a tiny
            bit of effort, a developer could have simply written a twenty-line
            script that would run in a browser to automate their entire job. If
            you learn the basics of coding, you can start thinking more like a
            developer. You can start thinking like someone whose job is to
            simplify, streamline, and automate. With these skills, you can
            customize automation specifically for your unique job and workflows.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Take Google Workspace Add-ons, for example. When you know how
            to code, you can use it to develop your own integrations with your
            choice of hosting, source control systems, development toolchains,
            coding language, and libraries. You can create and manage custom
            add-ons to turn regular tasks into “background tasks” and make your
            job easier<sup>120</sup>. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Automating tasks through simple code
            can be a game-changer for boosting productivity in any corporate
            job. By harnessing the power of automation, you can accomplish work
            faster and more efficiently. Here are a few tips to get you started:
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Data Manipulation: Use programming languages like Python or Excel
            macros to automate data manipulation tasks. Whether it's cleaning up
            spreadsheets, performing calculations, or generating reports, you
            can create reusable code snippets to handle these tasks swiftly.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Email Management: Tackle the overwhelming influx of emails by
            automating email sorting, filtering, and response generation. With
            tools like Microsoft Outlook or Gmail API, you can create rules to
            categorize emails, auto-respond to specific queries, or even trigger
            alerts for urgent messages. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Report Generation: Save time on generating repetitive reports by
            automating the process. Utilize programming languages or tools like
            Microsoft Power BI or Tableau to connect to data sources, create
            visualizations, and schedule report generation regularly. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • File Organization: Develop scripts or use file management tools
            like Hazel or Automator (on macOS) to organize files in designated
            folders based on predefined rules automatically. This can help keep
            your documents, presentations, and other files in order without
            thought. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Task Management: Boost your productivity by automating task
            management. Tools like Trello or Asana offer APIs or built-in
            automation features that allow you to create custom workflows,
            assign tasks, set reminders, and track progress automatically.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Remember: Automation is all about simplifying and speeding up
            repetitive processes. Start small, identify the tasks that consume a
            significant portion of your time, and find ways to automate them
            using simple code snippets or existing tools. With each successful
            automation, you'll work smarter, save time, and accomplish tasks
            faster. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Of course, you don’t necessarily have to do the
            automation yourself. Combine the powers of automation and
            outsourcing, and hire an automation expert to do it for you. You
            would be amazed at how much can be automated by professional
            developers. Literally, almost anything. The web is filled with
            smart, and sometimes hilarious, examples of developer
            ingenuity—including developers who have automated texting their
            wives, making themselves coffee as they arrive at the office, and
            automatically calling in sick if they are too
            hungover<sup>121</sup>. The possibilities are endless. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Yet,
            many companies simply don’t want to invest in developers. Despite
            this, many contract developers are pretty cheap to hire to help
            build a process specifically for you. Even in your current position,
            whatever your role, it’s a great learning experience to schedule a
            consultation with a professional software developer. They can help
            you find automation opportunities you didn't know existed—and not
            knowing what you don’t know is the biggest obstacle to your
            efficiency. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Hiring an automation expert to optimize your
            workflow at your nine-to-five job can be a game-changer for
            achieving overemployment. With their expertise, you can
            revolutionize your work processes, increase efficiency, and
            accomplish more in less time. You can find freelance automation
            experts on platforms like Fiverr, Upwork, Toptal, and Arc. It will
            cost money, but approach it as an investment: Their work can save
            you hours of work that can directly translate as a profit in the
            long run.

            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Outsource Everything You Can: Specialized Contractors
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Of course, automation isn’t the only way to accelerate your
            productivity. A true leader has delegation skills. They know what
            needs to get done. Even more, they know which tasks they need to do
            and which can be assigned to others for the most efficient,
            effective results. This leads us to our next productivity hack:
            Outsource everything you can, whether it's hiring an assistant or a
            contractor to write that first draft. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Outsourcing can be
            trickier than automating. Remember: Outsource to make yourself more
            productive, but don’t break the rules. You don’t want to outsource a
            hundred percent of your job. You want to ensure you deliver solid
            work and are involved in your day-to-day core processes. Many tasks,
            however, can be outsourced while still ensuring you deliver your
            unique value. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>The best approach is what I call the “Start and
            Finish Method:” <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Outsource the beginning and end of your
            project. Remember when we looked at the average day of a UX designer
            in Chapter 6? The first half and latter part of their day weren’t
            spent doing hands-on design work; instead, they spent most of their
            time researching, ideating, and collaborating. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Initial project
            research is one of the best tasks to outsource. Starting a project
            can be a major time suck. At the end of the day, you just need the
            most important information. So, have someone else get it for you.
            Hire a contractor to do initial research, analysis, and find
            information. Contractors can write up succinct, easy-to-digest
            reports to give you ideas and momentum, saving you days of research.
            This means you can then start your day focused on your core tasks.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>You can also hire a contractor to get that first draft out of
            the way. Outsource initial drafts or design idea boards to get
            yourself started. It eliminates "writer’s block" and the
            procrastination propelled by the fear and dread of staring at a
            blank page, hoping it will turn into a report, article, design, or
            block of code. With this initial draft or idea board, you can easily
            take it and turn it into a deliverable. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>On the other side, we
            have the finishing or polishing side of a project. Many of us spend
            far too much time perfecting our work. We’re finally done, but it
            takes us hours to polish the fine details. This is another area
            where outsourcing can save us: Outsource the editing, proofreading,
            and polishing portion of your work. Hire a contractor to be your
            last set of eyes, finalizing completed work, taking care of cleanup,
            and “dotting the i’s, crossing the t’s.” <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>It all ties back to
            the 80/20 rule. Of all the tasks you must do each day, only twenty
            percent of them will account for eighty percent of your
            results<sup>122</sup>. Your core tasks are your twenty percent.
            Overemployment is about whittling down what doesn’t matter—your
            least impactful tasks—so you can give the twenty percent your all.
            This is where your results lie. You can multiply your impact by
            outsourcing the small, less important tasks. You can concentrate and
            prioritize your energy, accomplishing all the major tasks or
            projects, then outsource the startup and cleanup portions. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>If
            your work is public or shareable, outsourcing quality assurance (QA)
            is a great way to do this. It actually improves your value because
            someone else is double-checking your work while you still get credit
            for the time it took. Getting a second set of eyes on your work is
            always valuable. In fact, our brains struggle to find our own
            errors. As the author of our own work, our brain goes to battle with
            our eyes: Our eyes want to see what's actually on the screen, while
            our brains look for the perfected version of the idea that only
            exists in our heads<sup>123</sup>. Outsourcing quality assurance can
            increase your value while saving you time. Yet another win-win for
            overemployment. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>When outsourcing, find someone you can
            consistently work with and keep them on retainer if necessary. It
            can take a lot of time to find a good contractor. Searching for new
            talent each time you need help can end up wasting more time. When
            looking for a contractor to work with long-term, keep these
            strategies in mind:
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Identify Your Needs: Assess your current workflow and identify
            areas that can benefit from an extra set of eyes or hands. Pinpoint
            tasks that are time-consuming, repetitive, or outside your scope of
            expertise. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Seek Expertise: Look for contractors who specialize in your
            industry or have experience streamlining workflows similar to yours.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Assess Experience: Request examples or case studies of their past
            projects. Review their portfolio to gauge their expertise in the
            area. Focus more on their portfolio than their resume. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Consider Their Availability: How quickly do they reply to your
            messages? How much notice will you be able to give them, and how
            fast will you need the projects? Be transparent about your timeline
            needs. You don't want to put yourself in a situation where you are
            counting on outsourcing a project, but the contractor isn't
            available. To avoid this, consider finding a backup contractor you
            trust that offers quick turnarounds. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Conduct Interviews: Conduct thorough interviews to assess the
            candidates' technical skills, communication abilities, and
            understanding of your specific needs. Start small, testing out a
            project before you promise any long-term work. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Collaborate on a Plan: Once you've chosen the right contractor,
            collaborate on a detailed plan. Clearly communicate your goals,
            timelines, and budget constraints. Get it in writing via a contract
            to keep everything secure.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Obviously, trust is a key part of outsourcing work. Your
            contract agreement should ensure the work is a hundred percent
            confidential and transferred under your/your company's copyright
            after payment. The contractor should be obligated to keep your
            agreement confidential as well as any information they learned about
            the company while working on the project. Try not to outsource any
            projects containing highly confidential or sensitive information
            about you, the company, or its users. To fully protect yourself,
            seek legal advice regarding liability issues.

            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Outsource Everything You Can: Virtual Assistants
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>If only there were two of you: You could focus on your core
            tasks: The high-priority projects and flows only you can take care
            of. Your extra set of hands could take care of the administrative
            work, communication, research, you name it. Well, it’s possible—all
            thanks to virtual assistants. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Virtual assistants are
            self-employed contractors specializing in administrative work.
            Often, you can hire them hourly to help boost your productivity and
            take care of certain tasks. This follows the idea of having a
            contractor on retainer, but it’s a little more permanent.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Virtual assistants are more generalized, so they can help with
            basic tasks like pre-sorting emails, setting up your daily goals and
            deliverables, and responding to mundane chats and emails. Since they
            are more generalized, you may lose some of the specialty you might
            find from a dedicated outsourced contractor. However, virtual
            assistants can become a major asset if administrative tasks consume
            too much of your workday. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>You see, virtual assistants can
            remove almost all distractions. They can make it so you’re not
            overwhelmed by busy work or compulsively checking your inboxes every
            twenty minutes. They can make it so you can stay in "hyperfocus,"
            dedicating your work time to the projects and tasks that require
            your undivided attention. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>However, there are different types
            of virtual assistants. Find one who specializes in assisting those
            in your field. You can find virtual assistants who specifically take
            care of tasks such as reporting, bookkeeping, social media
            management, website management, data entry, or
            transcription<sup>124</sup>. Between a virtual assistant and a
            reliable outsourced worker, you might not even have to open your
            computer some days. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>If you're uncomfortable hiring a virtual
            assistant, you might not have to look far. If you have a spouse,
            friend, or family member who would make a good assistant, consider
            hiring them to help streamline your workday. You can even make an
            LLC and hire someone as your legitimate assistant. Personally, my
            wife ended up working as my assistant and quality assurance
            specialist in the past. An in-person assistant will help keep you
            focused and on task. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Research shows virtual assistants boost
            productivity by an average of thirteen percent<sup>125</sup>. While
            it might not sound like much, thirteen percent of an eight-hour
            workday is just over one hour. This is an entire hour you get to
            yourself to relax, run errands, spend time with your family and
            friends, or get paid for another job each day. Remember this as you
            invest in outsourcing, whether to virtual assistants, in-person
            assistants, contractors, or automation experts.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Never Let Them Know
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Now, it’s worth touching on again, our most important rule of
            outsourcing and automating: Never, ever, let the company know you
            have improved a process via automation or outsourcing. If you can do
            more work, people will offload more work onto you. In a way, you’ll
            decrease your pay, doing more work for the same amount of money.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Don’t penalize your productivity. Corporations only care about
            what makes them money. Do the same for yourself and your career:
            Focus on improvements that make you more productive, not ones that
            make the company more productive. Use automated or improved
            processes to get more time to yourself. Automation and outsourcing
            allow you to spend your time delivering value. As a result, your
            company will get more value, and you’ll get more time—instead of the
            company robbing both the value and time. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>This is the final
            step. We’ve officially laid the groundwork for overemployment. From
            here, we’ll use our extra twenty-five hours per week to find your
            second (or third) job. Turn the page to start learning how to

          <p>
            TL; DR ( Too Long; Didn’t Read ) <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>—— <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Once you get your first job down to around fifteen hours per week,
            start looking for your second job. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Avoid schedule conflicts, competing companies, and meeting
            culture. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • The first ninety days of your second job are the hardest; be
            patient and resilient. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Don’t cross-contaminate. Use separate tech, equipment, systems,
            and schedules for each job. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Optimize three types of organization: Space, time, and mindset.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Schedule dedicated timeframes to focus on one job at a time. The
            goal is to enter a flow state and establish compartmentalized
            routines. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Burnout is real. Give yourself breaks to rest and recharge.

            Corporate America is a circus. It draws us in with its bright lights
            and benefits, but the truth is, we’re the circus animals. The
            puppets. The cast. We’re not running the show—we’re just pieces in
            it. If we aren’t careful, we can spend our lives doing the same
            tricks and routines, hoping to one day retire, escape the race, and
            finally enjoy our lives. But this is your career. Your life. You run
            the show. And for your final trick, you’re learning how to juggle
            jobs.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>If you’ve followed every step in this book, you should now be
            consistently working for approximately fifteen hours per week. Your
            next step? Rinse and repeat. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Now, it’s time for the payoff.
            Once you have control over your job and schedule, you should
            immediately start searching for another position to work at the same
            time. Much of this will be a repeat of the first half of this book.
            You will look for a remote, value-based, mid-level job with a
            company that values work-life balance and flexibility. You’ll use
            your resume-building skills from Chapter 3 and your interview
            techniques from Chapter 4 to secure it. Follow the same rules
            outlined in the previous chapters, and soon enough, you’ll land your
            second job—or “J2,” as the overemployment culture likes to call it.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>You might feel more confident this second time around. That’s
            great—but be careful not to get too comfortable or lazy. Full
            disclosure: The ninety-day period for your second job is
            tough—extremely tough. It's the most mentally challenging part of
            the overemployment journey. It’s painful. It will feel like a lot of
            extra work. But if you persist and get past it, it will all be worth
            it. If you get past that ninety-day mark for your J2, you’ll
            actually be grateful for the mundanity. You’ll have no trouble
            managing your work. In fact, if you can get both jobs down to that
            sweet, fifteen-hour-per-week spot, you’ll still be working fewer
            hours than your old forty-hour workweek—and possibly double the pay.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>The Rules of J2: Searching for Your Second Job
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>The search for your J2 will be mostly similar to your search
            for your first job, or "J1," but for this to work, you’ll need the
            right strategy. We’ll start with the job search.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Beyond the guidelines in Chapter 2, there are a few more rules
            for finding the right J2:
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>J2 Rule #1: Avoid schedule conflicts at all costs.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Don't just take it from me: A study of multiple job holders
            uncovered a few interesting patterns in what makes overemployment a
            positive or negative experience. Those who were satisfied with their
            jobs made friends at their jobs. Even more, they benefited from the
            positive spill-over effects of overemployment (more on that later).
            Those who weren't satisfied with working multiple jobs were wracked
            by the stress of it all: Mainly the conflicts between their work
            schedules<sup>126</sup>. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Now, this seems like a given, but the
            entire point of overemployment is to reduce stress. It’s to free up
            your time and take back control. The wrong J2—specifically a J2 with
            a conflicting schedule—can do just the opposite. It can hold you
            captive to your own calendar. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>To prevent this, narrow your
            search by looking for positions that seamlessly work with your J1.
            Look for jobs in a different time zone than your J1 for the best
            results. For example, many companies start the day or week with a
            meeting, but what if both of your jobs want to kick off Monday with
            a 9 a.m. meeting? If your J1's company is based out of the East
            Coast and your J2's is on the West Coast, there’s no problem. With
            two different time zones, you can stress less about overlapping
            morning meetings or afternoon check-ins. This helps balance
            meetings, schedules, and work times. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Of course, the best way
            to ensure minimal schedule conflicts between your jobs is to find an
            ‘async’ company where times don’t really matter: As long as you get
            the job done, they don't care what times of day you work.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>J2 Rule #2: Avoid working with competing companies.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Your schedule is just one piece of the puzzle. As you search
            for your next job, you’ll need to find the right balance of
            crossover. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Crossover is a double-edged sword. You want to
            avoid a crossover of schedules at all costs. To reduce any
            liability, you’ll want to avoid working for competing companies. And
            please: Don't apply for another government job if your J1 is a
            government job. We want to keep your jobs as neat, organized, and
            separate as possible. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Again: This is not legal advice. I work
            lots of jobs, but none of them are in law. If you want to ensure the
            most protection, seek legal advice. However, at the basic level,
            working for a competing company is one of the easiest ways to get
            into a troublesome overemployment situation. Almost every company
            outlines some sort of non-compete clause in their employment
            contracts. Instead of blindly scrolling past the terms and
            conditions, take the time to read and understand the standards
            before you sign your rights away.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>J2 Rule #3: Take advantage of the spill-over effect.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>On the flip side, a good amount of crossover will make your
            life easier. This is what we call the "spill-over effect." The
            spill-over effect occurs when an action or element in one
            environment affects or “spills into” another environment. In this
            context, the environments are your J1 and J2. If you’re not careful,
            you can become a victim of negative spill-over effects: Your
            unrealistic demands or schedules in one job can cause you to slack
            on the other, turning your plans into a chaotic mess. However, in
            the previously mentioned study, those who enjoyed holding multiple
            jobs used the spill-over effect to their advantage. Specifically,
            this occurred for those with multiple jobs in the same field or
            industry. If there is at least some overlap, you’ll save time by not
            having to invest in further education, practice, or domain ramp-up.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>For example, you probably don’t want to become a graphic
            designer for two competing marketing firms. Instead, you might land
            your J1 as a graphic designer for a marketing agency and your J2 as
            a UI/UX designer for a local government sector. You might not do the
            exact same tasks at each job, but the time you spend in each role
            will improve your skills in both jobs. Your experience will spill
            over, and you’ll minimize the learning curve as you sharpen your
            skills and optimize your schedule. Choosing two completely different
            jobs can require more brain power. Let your jobs complement, not
            compete, with each other.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>J2 Rule #4: Meetings are enemy number one.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>For your jobs to optimally complement each other, you’ll want
            to do everything possible to avoid getting sucked into meeting
            culture. Meetings are the largest obstacle for job juggling. You can
            outsource and automate your workflows but can’t do the same for your
            meetings. During the interview, get a clear idea of the company’s
            meeting cadence and culture. This is a pretty normal follow-up
            question for most jobs: <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>“Do you typically have a lot of
            face-to-face meetings and discussions, or does your company prefer
            to communicate more async?” <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>If this question somehow loses you
            the job, that’s a good thing—you just dodged a bullet, but if the
            company is a good candidate for overemployment, you’ll hit the
            jackpot.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>J2 Rule #5: Be patient and give yourself time in the first
            ninety days.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Remember: The first ninety days of your first gig did not
            consist of breezy fifteen-hour weeks. You had to have a dedicated,
            strategic commitment to securing, understanding, and optimizing your
            job. It will take a lot of work when you first start juggling. Be
            prepared for long work weeks, weekend work, and high stress. But be
            patient—by following the path to automate and reduce your hours,
            soon enough, you will find balance. Taking a “vacation” from your J1
            for the first couple of weeks at J2 may make sense. Typically, the
            first couple weeks require the most in-person time: Chats, meeting
            everyone, domain ramp-ups, and so on. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Spending your PTO
            working is a drag, but remember, the ultimate goal is to vacation
            for the rest of your life. Think of this time as an investment in
            enjoying more time and money in the future.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>J2 Rule #6: Keep it on the down-low.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Keep everything low-key. Don't forget: There are only ever a
            few degrees of separation from your goals and letting it slip that
            you are working multiple jobs. It’s a slippery slope: You tell an
            acquaintance about your overemployment; they bring it up in a
            conversation with their friend; their friend knows someone who works
            there… and suddenly, your boundaries are crossed and plans foiled.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Overemployment isn’t about becoming the employee of the month.
            It isn’t about rising in the ranks and retiring at sixty-five with a
            corporate gold star. It’s about building your career. It’s about
            taking back your time. It’s about making your life truly yours
            behind the corporate facade. Keep your overemployment goals close to
            the vest, and you’ll be able to enjoy everything you’ve worked hard
            to achieve. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>This goes beyond your social circles. Do not
            mention your J1 in your J2. For the most part, the only time your
            "old job" will come up is during the onboarding process. If (and
            only if) they ask questions about your employment status, don’t be
            afraid to mention that you work with another company. You almost
            certainly don’t want to say you work full-time, but it can be
            helpful to say you may continue to work a little with your previous
            employer if they ask. This judgment call is up to you. The safest
            route is to be as private as possible. Only share information if
            you’re asked. Don’t volunteer it. Set your boundaries, and hold
            them. If you’re committed to getting the job done, they don’t need
            to know how you spend the rest of your time. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Don’t forget the
            small details, like your LinkedIn profile, either. While you might
            be excited to take on your second job, don’t go updating your
            LinkedIn or public social media profiles. It may be best to take
            everything offline or go private. Most people only use LinkedIn for
            job searching and networking anyway. Log out and go inactive until
            you need it again. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>The best way I tackled this was during the
            onboarding planning. Most companies want to know your plan for
            leaving your previous employer and your start date. Simply say you
            can start within two weeks, and there will be a little bit of a
            ramp-down period with your previous employer. If they ask, you’ll
            just be helping them out during your free time or on an as-needed
            basis.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>J2 Rule #7: Don’t be afraid to walk away.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again: If the workload,
            meeting schedule, or company culture is not what was promised, don’t
            be afraid to walk away. Even if you’re in too deep, you can still
            walk away. You have the right to do so. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Having multiple jobs
            should be “freeing.” You gain job security and income while losing
            the stress associated with potentially losing your only job. If you
            find yourself in a position where both of your jobs are in jeopardy
            due to your J2 being too demanding, don’t be afraid to leave.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>The Most Important Rule: Don’t Cross-Contaminate Your Jobs.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Now for the golden rule of overemployment: Keep your jobs
            separate. Cross-contaminating your jobs is the quickest way to
            poison all your hard work and put it to waste. This is more than
            just not talking about your other job—it takes strategy, care, and,
            most importantly, organization skills (which we’ll dive into later
            in this chapter). <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>You’ll want to do everything you can to
            compartmentalize your J1 and your J2. This starts simple: Buy two of
            everything. Make sure you have dedicated technology for each job.
            Use different computers, keyboards, mice, desks, headphones, pens,
            pencils, you name it, for each job. Set it up so it’s almost as
            separate as commuting to two different offices in your own home. The
            more you physically and digitally divide each job, the easier it
            will be to separate the two mentally. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>While this is great for
            your mindset, it’s also tactical. You can get into trouble for using
            work laptops or company technology for other work. It’ll be easy to
            poke holes in your story or spill confidential information into the
            wrong place if you’re lazy with your organization tactics.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Technology makes overemployment possible, but it’s also one of
            your greatest threats. You’ll need to set up defenses against
            digital ‘leaks’ of information between jobs. To reinforce your
            boundaries, use physical organization strategies instead of
            digital—use physical journals, planners, calendars, sticky notes,
            and other organizational tools when you can. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>It’s incredibly
            easy to share or leak digital information accidentally. Without
            thinking, screen sharing, tab histories, and the wrong window focus
            can instantly grant others access to your private information. You
            reduce the risk if your technology, profiles, and tools are
            physically and digitally separate. Using as many physical
            organization tools as possible significantly reduces the risk of
            digital leaks and creates completely separate digital profiles to
            help keep the division. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Your setup is up to you. When it comes
            to cross-corporate-contamination prevention, you want to make it
            practically impossible to accidentally reply to an incorrect
            message, leak sensitive digital information, or mix up your J1 and
            J2 in any way.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Three Types of Organization: Space, Time, and Mindset
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Juggling requires skill. To become an overemployment pro,
            you’ll need to master the three main organizational elements: Space,
            time, and mental organization. We’ll start with your space.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Organizing your physical space will lay a solid foundation for
            compartmentalization. Now, I’m not here to share the "secret hack"
            you’ve been searching for all your life to finally get organized.
            Spoiler alert: It doesn’t exist. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Find your system—the one that
            works for you. Everyone has different ways of staying organized.
            It’s like dieting; the real key is finding a system you can stick
            to. Find an organization system that fits your life and can be
            maintained, and learn to optimize it for overemployment.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Personally, I’m obsessed with sticky notes. There’s something
            both satisfying and secure about using a physical organization
            system. Right now, I have three jobs. So, I use three different
            colored sticky notes: One for each job. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Each sticky note has a
            task with a rough estimate of the time it will take. I stick the
            notes on each of my monitors, as each monitor coincides with the
            importance of the tasks. My main monitor (i.e., the one right in
            front of me) is where I stick all the tasks that need to be done
            today: Tasks on the bottom of the monitor and meetings on the top.
            On my secondary monitor, I queue sticky notes with low-priority
            tasks lined up for the next couple of days. It’s my way of
            organizing and prioritizing tasks so that I take care of first
            things first. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>To some, this might feel like a streak of
            genius. To others, it looks like the lab of a mad scientist. All
            that matters is that it works for me. Plus, I get to enjoy the
            physical reward of stacking the notes into a little pile to show
            myself how much I accomplished during the week. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Again, your
            organization method is up to you. At the basic level, you should
            have separate devices for each job. Keep your calendars, planners,
            and other organization tools separate for each digital or physical
            job. Physically compartmentalizing your jobs with separate devices,
            folders, and tools will make it much easier to compartmentalize them
            mentally. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>This includes keeping your home space separate from
            your workspace. If the physical line between work and home is
            blurry, you’ll never be able to fully “clock out” and enjoy the
            freedom of overemployment. Your home office should keep you separate
            from distractions. Distractions can take on many meanings. For some,
            it’s the distraction of wanting to watch TV, talk with your partner
            or family, or do the dishes instead of work. By keeping your
            workspace organized and separate from the rest of your home, you can
            find your flow, limit distractions, and get the job done.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Become a Time-Management Master
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Onto our next element: Time. The objective of overemployment
            is getting your time back. With the right time management skills,
            you can. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>As we’ve learned, time can work for or against you.
            In the traditional nine-to-five structure, we waste over half of our
            time either procrastinating, working on fruitless tasks, or simply
            transitioning from task to task. To succeed in overemployment, the
            aim is to free more of your time by eliminating these “time
            wasters.” With this newfound freedom, it can be tempting to see the
            whole “working on your own time” as an invitation to work for thirty
            minutes, watch TV, work for another hour, clean the house, get
            another hour in, hit the gym, and repeat. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Pro tip: This
            doesn’t work. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Freedom requires focus. You need a routine to
            find your flow. Getting distracted from your ‘flow state' has costs.
            As we’ve learned, you take at least twenty-five minutes to get back
            into your flow after getting distracted. Losing your momentum by
            switching tasks and contexts has costs. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Our goal is to find
            this flow state and stay in it. Here, you can get as much done in as
            little time as possible without feeling forced. This concept was
            founded by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, a pioneer of positive
            psychology. In his research, he found a few key factors that can
            help you enter and stay in a flow state:
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Have precise goals and objectives for your task. You should
            clearly know what it will mean to complete the task. If it’s an
            ongoing project, set a milestone for how much you’ll finish that
            day. Give yourself an intention and a finish line.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Concentrate on a specific task rather than a bunch of tasks.
            You can't find your flow jumping from one task to another. Use
            time-blocking strategies to concentrate on your core tasks. Turn off
            the unimportant notifications, and dive in.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Have the skills needed to complete the task while still being
            challenged: When it’s too hard, it’s easy to give up. When it’s too
            easy, it’s boring. The key is to lean in and take advantage of your
            skills while still pushing yourself to innovate and produce quality
            work (again, this isn’t "quiet quitting”).
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Find a sense of control and freedom: We don’t want to be told
            to do something. No one wants to be micromanaged. This is one of the
            benefits of becoming a project leader. As you find and make
            something that’s yours, you can find the control and freedom you
            need to feel motivated and enter a flow state as you work.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Be Mindful. Less being in your head and thinking, and more
            just doing. Don’t waste time thinking about what you’ll do or how
            you’ll do it. Plan at the beginning of the day, and get to work. Be
            present. Focus on the task at hand, and worry about the rest of the
            details later. This means you can’t get caught up staring at the
            clock or over-planning. Set an alarm or reminder if there’s an
            important deadline or meeting. Other than that, just get going.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>It must be rewarding to you personally, not just the company.
            This can be your motivation to achieve overemployment. Find your
            ‘why’—a deeper purpose that reaches beyond paychecks and
            checklists<sup>127</sup>.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>We have all entered this flow state from time to time—how can
            we achieve and stay at this level of focus each day? In the earlier
            study, some of those who worked two jobs in one day didn’t perceive
            the downtime between jobs as a recovery period. We can learn an
            important lesson from this: Jumping back and forth between your J1
            and J2 won’t work. This will deflate your productivity and increase
            the likelihood of negative spillover. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Dedicate time frames to
            dive into one job at a time specifically. Set your schedule for your
            J1 and J2, and stick to it. It can be easy to suffer from the
            overload of multitasking. Even just thinking about other tasks while
            trying to focus can prevent you from finding your flow. This routine
            will help turn your plans into habits, taking much of the work out
            of it. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Still, you can’t be in a flow state twenty-four/seven.
            Productivity and time management require balance. Dedicate time to
            fully unplug from each job. Do what you can to ensure this time
            feels like a recovery period. Jumping from one job to the next can
            be mentally exhausting. Allow yourself to transition and let your
            brain recharge between jobs. You can even set these transitions with
            your employer beforehand. If your job isn’t async, work with your
            employer to see if you can customize your schedule so you don't have
            to take breaks secretly. For example, you might tell your employer
            you need to start Thursday mornings later due to personal conflicts,
            but you’ll “work a bit later.” Lucky for you, you'll already have
            the work done and can use the extra time to rest or catch up.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Having set hours, or even set days, for each gig can be a
            game-changer. Once I’d gotten into a decent flow, I dedicated a day
            of the week to each gig to get stuff done and keep everything
            separate: Mondays and Tuesdays were for organization and catch-up,
            Wednesdays for J1, Thursdays for J2, and Fridays for J3. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>This
            is what works for me—find a flow that works for you. That might mean
            waking up early, working in the evening, or moving your working
            hours to weekends. The goal is to create a schedule and routine that
            allow you to dive into your flow state and tackle your core tasks.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>From here, your biggest barrier will be balancing the various
            meetings, notifications, chats, and emails. Moving your core work
            hours outside the standard nine-to-five can expose you to the least
            interruptions. Working outside these hours, you’ll quickly notice
            how much work you get done when being alone vs. working with other
            people, even remotely. If you move working hours to a time when
            you're not bombarded by chat or emails, you can get your work done
            quickly. Move some of the work to the weekend, early mornings, late
            evenings, or any time you won’t be interrupted by notifications.
            Then, your nine-to-five will mostly be free time—with occasional
            meeting disruption. You can just be halfway “on” during hours for
            emails and chats (or have your virtual assistant handle it and let
            you know when you’re actually needed).
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Become a Mental-State Master
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Don't mentally cross-contaminate your jobs. Your mind's files
            will get messy fast if you don’t organize and compartmentalize the
            information in your brain. You’ll send the wrong email, submit the
            wrong project, or potentially share confidential information with
            the wrong team. You can’t afford these mistakes. Of course, you're
            human, you can make mistakes, but getting your jobs mixed up isn’t a
            mistake you want to make. The good news is, it’s avoidable. Your
            space and time organization will lay the groundwork. By sticking to
            these separate systems, you can train your brain to "clock out" of
            one job and "clock in" to another. Your consistent schedule will
            help make it easy. With time and practice, your mind will know that
            "Mondays are for J1," "mornings are for J2," and so on. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Simple
            mental tricks can get you far. Train your brain to remember that
            being at one desk means you're focused on your J1, and being at
            another desk means you're focused on your J2. Think of each as a
            different office. Associate specific colors with each company. Set
            your desktop backgrounds, sticky notes, tags, journals, and planners
            to a unique color for each job (i.e., blue for J1, red for J2.).
            These identifiers will help you consciously and subconsciously
            distinguish between the two. Even the action of putting on a
            different set of headphones will help you shift your mindset to the
            right job. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>It’s also helpful to break up the day into two
            chunks: For example, mornings for J1 and evenings for J2. Give
            yourself time to transition between jobs. Schedule these chunks onto
            your personal calendar. The goal here is to eliminate the
            back-and-forth task of switching between jobs. Consistent timeframes
            and blocked-out times can increase productivity and prevent risky
            crossover. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>To help, create a routine or ritual for signing in
            and out of each job. It can be simple, such as if you start your J1
            in the early morning, make a habit of making your cup of coffee
            right before starting. Make it a habit—something you always do
            before “clocking in.” Make another simple yet unique ritual for J2.
            If you switch halfway through the day, change your outfit. Take a
            walk around the block. Find a small, simple, yet consistent action
            you can take to mentally “change the channel” in your brain and
            signify that it's time for your next job. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Above all, create a
            system to ensure you don’t get your jobs mixed up. During the first
            ninety days, make sure you take the time to remember everyone’s
            names. Create a cheat sheet at each job’s desk if you need it.
            Compartmentalize your documents, emails, and workflow with unique
            profiles and sign-ins. You shouldn’t share any profiles, data, or
            tech between each job. This may require you to buy more equipment
            than you’d need with one job, but remember: It’s an investment.
            You’ll earn the money back quickly by working two or more jobs.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>In the end, your organizational systems will get you far. With
            consistent effort, you’ll train your brain to compartmentalize jobs
            and habituate the flow state of productivity. However, always
            remember that sometimes, no matter how great your systems are,
            you’ll face your “I just can’t” days –the days where you look at
            your to-do lists, sticky notes, and systems, and it all feels
            daunting instead of doable. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Most people will tell you to push
            through these days, but there’s power in steering into them. I don’t
            care who you are—everyone experiences days where they just can't
            focus, work, or get things done. Learn to identify these days and
            lean into them. It’s substantially more effective to get the rest
            your brain is asking for than it is to force yourself to work all
            day and not recover. This is one of Csikszentmihalyi’s core findings
            about the flow state—you can’t force it. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Burnout is one of the
            greatest dangers to your overemployment goals (and, let’s face it,
            your sanity). One of the fastest tracks to burnout is forcing
            yourself to work even when you're fried. As a result, you push
            yourself further down the hole instead of giving yourself the time,
            space, and rest you need to climb out of it. Lean into days you are
            feeling burnt out and give yourself a break to keep your
            overemployment lifestyle is sustainable. If you’ve automated,
            outsourced, and organized your jobs correctly, you can typically get
            away with just taking the day for yourself. It sounds backward, but
            the rest is productive. In fact, research shows slowing down at work
            when you need it can boost creativity, concentration, and
            efficiency<sup>128</sup>. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Overall, overemployment pushes you.
            It shows you how much you can truly do and be. But you’re still
            human. Push yourself just the right amount, and you’ll move forward;
            push yourself too far, and you’ll tumble downward. If you read about
            most overemployed workers' experiences, you’ll find their greatest
            obstacle is burnout. This defeats the purpose: We’re looking for
            freedom, not burnout. Remember that.

            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Tips and Tricks
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Of course, you’ll still need to get up and get going the next
            day. After getting rest, give yourself an extra boost by using
            ‘brain hacks’ to improve your productivity and make sure you don’t
            slack:
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • The inertia hack: An object in motion stays in motion, right? If
            you don’t feel like working, find the smallest possible task you can
            complete, even if it’s emptying the dishwasher or responding to just
            one email. Find momentum by starting with the smallest task and
            going from there. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Visualize your progress measurements: We often don’t realize how
            much we get done in a day or week. This is the power of visualizing
            your progress. We're more motivated to keep going when we can see
            how much we’ve accomplished. Each check on the list and increase in
            the progress bar fuels us to do it again. It’s a part of our
            psychology. Research shows our brains release dopamine as a reward
            each time we complete a task, making us feel good about our
            productivity<sup>129</sup>. Visual reminders of these
            accomplishments increase these feelings, motivating us to keep
            going. For me, it’s that pile of sticky notes that builds up as the
            week goes on. Whether it’s progress bars, checklists, or stacks of
            sticky notes, create a visual reminder of how much you've
            accomplished. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Find and use your peak mental hours: We explored these in Chapter
            6. Identify which times your brain has the easiest time
            concentrating, and align your work schedule accordingly. Don’t force
            yourself to be an early bird just because it’s what every self-help
            guru recommends. Tune into your internal clock, and time it to your
            advantage. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Trick your mind with your wardrobe: Sometimes, it's the little
            things: Like how wearing shoes can make you more productive. Yes,
            it's even research-backed. You see, wearing shoes is a
            context-dependent memory: We wear shoes when we’re out of the house
            doing things and being productive. Wearing shoes inside your home
            can trigger this mindset, helping you be more productive than you
            would when working barefoot or in your favorite
            slippers<sup>130</sup>. It works the same with all types of clothes.
            Dress as you would when going to the office, and you might find
            yourself more focused and organized than you would in your pajamas.
            Lounge clothes tell your body it’s time to relax, not enter the flow
            state of productivity.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Habit stacking: Trying to adopt a new habit for overemployment?
            Stack it. Habit stacking is the idea of attaching a new habit to an
            existing habit. Let’s say you already have the habit of making
            yourself a coffee in the morning. Now, you want to get in the habit
            of making a prioritized to-do list each morning. So, while you enjoy
            your cup of coffee, make your to-do list. Stacking the habit onto an
            existing action will be much easier than creating a new
            routine<sup>131</sup>.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Turn off notifications: I’ve said it once, and I’ll say it again:
            Even if you think you can ignore your notifications, you probably
            can’t. Our phones have become a part of us: We always keep them with
            us, never leaving the house without them. This is more than
            utility—it’s dependency. The phones themselves aren’t what we’re
            addicted to. It’s the notifications. Just like completing a task
            triggers dopamine, so does getting a notification. Our brain rewards
            us for achieving successful social interactions. Eventually, we get
            a dopamine rush from the ‘ding’ or the ‘buzz’ of a notification.
            Whether it’s a text, email, or the like, our brains often process
            the notification as a reward. When we constantly check our
            notifications, we crave them. We become notification addicts. Soon
            enough, it’s nearly impossible not to open the notification when we
            hear it and reward our brains with dopamine, even if the message is
            not exciting<sup>132</sup>. So, turn it off, put it away, and let
            your brain focus.

            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Sustaining Your Growth: Balance & Awareness
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>As you follow these rules and apply these strategies, you may
            notice an interesting side effect of working multiple jobs: As you
            pursue a goal, especially one that’s outside the box or stretches
            societal norms, you may find yourself more motivated to improve in
            other areas. Steer into this in a positive way for continued growth.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Set goals, eat well, exercise, stay motivated, and
            continuously work to better yourself. I know it sounds like generic
            self-help book advice, but there’s a reason we’re all repeating
            ourselves: It’s important. If you aren’t careful, letting
            overemployment unbalance your life can be easy. You can get greedy,
            using any drop of free time to take on another job and another job
            instead of taking back your time: The core goal of overemployment.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>If you use the recommendations in this book, you’ll be in
            control of your work—not the other way around. You’re in the
            driver’s seat. Don’t play a zero-sum game, trading one bad habit for
            another. You don’t have to lose something for every gain. With more
            time and freedom, you can focus on what really matters: Health,
            family, happiness, and financial freedom. You can have a balance of
            it all: You just need self-awareness. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>You need to know when
            you’re overdoing it in one area and lacking in another. Mastering
            all three organizational elements will not only help you take
            control over your jobs but also help you take control over your
            life, giving you a sense of awareness you might not have had before.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Use this renewed awareness and motivation to gain better
            self-esteem and a healthier ego, knowing you deliver more value to
            the world. Use this renewed, positive energy to boost yourself even
            further. You'll feel more freedom as you build wealth, job security,
            and satisfaction. What you do with that freedom is what really
            matters.

          <p>
            You did it—you have outsmarted corporate America.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>So… Now what?
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Working multiple jobs is not easy, but the payoff is greater
            than you could ever imagine. As you get into the rhythm of juggling
            multiple jobs, you will notice more opportunities. The numbers in
            your bank account will start to stack up, your sense of freedom will
            grow, and ultimately you will be left with two main options:
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Lifestyle Inflation: As you increase your income, you can
            increase your cost of living accordingly. You can use your extra
            income as a "bonus" to buy a bigger house, get your dream car, or go
            on endless vacations. This sounds great, but soon enough, you will
            begin to rely on this extra income. It will no longer become "extra
            income" but money you need to pay your new bills. All that freedom
            we talked about will become nothing more than a pipe-dream. Instead
            of having a second job as a security blanket, you must maintain it
            and, even worse, worry about losing it.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Financial Freedom: You can start taking advantage of your
            newfound wealth by treating it as savings and investment money. You
            don’t consider your second paycheck as “extra money” but rather a
            tool to use in the financial game. With this mindset, you will be
            well on your way to financial freedom. Then you can buy the bigger
            home, the dream car, or endless vacations without the stress of “Can
            I actually afford this?” ringing in your ears.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>The first path invites you to enjoy instant gratification:
            Pleasure you can enjoy now but not necessarily later. Any time we
            suddenly have new income, we are threatened by lifestyle inflation:
            Adjusting our expenses and purchases to match the increase in our
            incomes<sup>133</sup>. This sounds more fun at first, but the truth
            is, you cannot work two jobs forever. If you tie a second job to
            your cost of living, you are setting yourself up for financial ruin.
            If you inflate your spending to match your income, you will have to
            keep working two jobs. Ultimately, you will end up relying on two
            incomes instead of being freed by them—and you will absolutely burn
            out and fail. Lifestyle inflation caused by overemployment is a
            guaranteed path to financial disaster.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Paving the Path to Financial Freedom
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Now, I’m not here to give you the step-by-step guide to
            reaching financial freedom, you can find that from many other books
            on the self-help shelf. Instead, I’m here to remind you that the
            freedom you want is all a mindset game. If you don't change your
            thinking, develop your strategy, and set your budget, you'll end up
            with a cost of living that requires you to work multiple jobs.
            Financial freedom is making enough money so that, if you wanted, you
            could quit your jobs tomorrow and be fine for the rest of your life.
            You're financially independent. Your finances don't depend on your
            employment or others. You no longer have to trade your time for
            money. That's the freedom that comes from financial independence,
            and it is possible. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>To reach financial freedom, you can lower
            your cost of living, increase your income, or both. You cannot
            increase your income and increase your cost of living. The
            overemployment strategy focuses on raising your income and treating
            your additional earnings as investments and savings. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>It sounds
            simple, but it’s a practice most people can’t get down. The average
            American increases their liabilities and cost of living when they
            get more money. They see extra money as something to spend, not
            save. This is where they instantly lose the true potential value of
            multiple incomes. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Now, I’m not telling you not to spend any of
            your hard-earned money, just that if you act smart, your second
            job’s salary can be your one-way ticket out of corporate America.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Making the Most of Your Multiple Incomes
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>It all starts with a strategy. If you don't make a plan,
            you'll leave your second paycheck up for grabs. Soon enough, it will
            disappear, inflate your cost of living, and add to your stress.
            Let's avoid that. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Whether it’s your first or second paycheck,
            move the money you earn from one job into a separate bank account
            with specific goals in mind. Let's say your first paycheck takes
            care of your bills and daily spending. In that case, your second
            paycheck should not touch those accounts—it should go straight into
            your separate account for debt repayment, savings, or investments.
            If life happens and disaster strikes, you can pull from your J2
            income if you need to. That’s just one part of the freedom and
            relief overemployment provides. Otherwise, your J2 income is slowly
            compounding, reducing your retirement age, or giving you the option
            to one day move off the grid, make your own life, and mind your own
            business. The options are endless. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>You see, multiple incomes
            have nonlinear returns. Double the earnings does not just double
            your savings or halve your debt lifespans—it does a lot more than
            that. When you increase your income, you can increase your savings
            or reduce your debt exponentially faster. Simple math can show us
            how effective this can be. If you save ten percent a month from your
            first paycheck, adding an entire other paycheck into your savings
            account means you’d save 1000 percent more each month, not just
            double. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>These rates of return can be used in conjunction with
            analyzing your interest rates to gain even better exponential
            returns. Look at your investment opportunities and debt interest
            rates, and put money where the interest lies. After all, it was
            Albert Einstein who famously quoted “Compound interest is the eighth
            wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it… he who
            doesn’t… pays it.” If you have high-interest debt, it most likely
            makes sense to reduce it as quickly as possible. This is called the
            avalanche method: Start by using your extra money to pay off your
            highest interest rate loans first to save as much money as you can
            in the long run<sup>134</sup>. It is not as exciting to use your new
            income to pay off your debt, but doing so will pay you back later.
            This means more investments, savings, and opportunities to live life
            your way. To be free from debt, obligations, and high interest
            rates. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Take your mortgage, for example. If you double your
            monthly mortgage payment, it doesn't cut the loan life in half.
            Depending on your interest rate, it can have a much larger
            effect—reducing the life span of your loan significantly. Even using
            your second paycheck to make just one extra payment a year can save
            you about five years in mortgage payments on average<sup>135</sup>.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Let's do the math: In 2023, the average American pays over
            $1,500 per month on their mortgage payment<sup>136</sup>. Using the
            median interest rate for the last thirty years and an average
            $300,000 home, doubling the payment each month would result in
            almost a twenty-year reduction of the time-to-payoff and save just
            over the cost of the entire home in interest. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>The main point
            is that your extra paycheck can help you pay off loans quicker—and
            doing so not only saves you more in the long run but opens up even
            more opportunities for financial freedom: imagine owning your home
            outright and never having to make a mortgage payment again, the
            freedom and peace of mind that would offer. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>When you start
            paying off debt or investing, you increase those percentages. If you
            play the percentage game, first tackling any debt, then moving on to
            investing, your nonlinear returns will stack even more
            exponentially. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>What would this mean for you? In 2022, the
            average American household debt was $101,915. The average mortgage
            debt was $236,443, $22,612 for car loans, and $18,255 for personal
            loans<sup>137</sup>. An extra paycheck can free you from these
            debts. It can put you on the fast track toward financial freedom. In
            this lane, your money, jobs, and stress can occupy less space in
            your time, mind, and energy, so you can focus on what truly matters.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Remember: The more you invest, the more you earn. It
            compounds. Your numbers and timeline may be different, and that’s
            okay. All that matters is that you make a plan to make the most out
            of your money. We’re working smarter, not just harder, in the office
            and in our bank accounts. That’s what financial freedom is all
            about.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Finding Personal Peace and Financial Freedom
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>I’ve been following the overemployment formula for years
            now—and I’ve made over half a million dollars in extra income by
            carrying up to four jobs at the same time. This is money that has
            freed me to make my own decisions and live life the way I choose.
            Instead of grinding out my days in an office for forty or more hours
            a week until I’m sixty-five, I enjoy my time, money, and freedom
            when I want to. I can do what I want—and corporate America doesn’t
            have a say in how I live my life. Follow the principles in this
            book, and this can be your reality, too. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Of course, "financial
            freedom" can mean something different for each of us. You can find
            several routes under the FI/RE ("Financial Independence/Retire
            Early") movement: An ideology where professionals work hard and save
            up to achieve financial freedom well before the standard retirement
            age. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>As we know, financial independence is being able to stop
            working and still have all the money you need. It’s not spending
            limitless amounts of money, it's having everything you need without
            relying on one source of income or trading your time for money.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>The FI/RE movement, for example, focuses on a “financial
            freedom number.” Once you hit your "financial freedom number,"
            you've reached financial independence and can retire early if you
            choose. The formula is pretty simple: <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Your Annual Expenses x
            25 = Your Financial Freedom Number<sup>138</sup>. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>With this
            number saved up, you should be able to quit your jobs and have
            enough money saved to support your current lifestyle and cost of
            living. You’d stop working and keep spending the same. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>This
            isn't for everyone. That's why there are different types of FIRE.
            For some, it's making enough so they can simply "coast" to
            traditional retirement age. Once they hit the right number, they
            stop saving completely. Instead, they live off their savings and
            liquified investments until they can withdraw from their retirement
            savings. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>For others, “retiring” early still means working
            part-time to supplement their income. This could be one of your
            current jobs, a hobby job, starting your own business, or doing what
            you want rather than just what pays well<sup>139</sup>. You don’t
            need to retire fully, but if you use the tactics in this book, you
            can semi-retire. The options are endless. It’s up to you. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>In
            overemployment, you put yourself in the driver's seat. Corporate
            America is no longer calling the shots—you are. It's less about the
            company and more about your career. You work on your time. You
            increase your income on your terms. You have a safety net if life
            happens and you lose one of your jobs. This added security and
            salary act as a way to take back control and expand your freedom.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>This is where it all comes together:
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Learn a Value Skill
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>In Chapter One, we pulled back the curtain on corporate
            America. We revealed the truth, debunking the myth of the mandatory
            forty-hour workweek. We shifted from "time jobs" that require you to
            trade your time for money and transitioned to "value jobs" that
            offer pay for your skill, knowledge, and contributions. With
            research showing that only about three hours of a workday are
            productive, you started the overemployment journey to scale your
            income without sacrificing more time.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Find the Right Job
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>In Chapter Two, you learned how to find these value-based
            jobs. You searched for mid-level, slow-moving remote positions. You
            pinned down the "red and green flags" of mid to large-sized
            companies with cultures that support the overemployment setup. You
            let go of loyalty to just one company and chose loyalty to your
            career. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>You focused on searching for value jobs that don't
            require an overwhelming amount of education or experience; or a
            value job you already have the skills for. In doing so, you
            understood how working two mid-level jobs as an individual
            contributor can grant you much more pay than working one
            senior-level job forever.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Make Yourself Hireable
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>In Chapter Three, we made it as easy as possible to land your
            ideal job by taking advantage of the flawed hiring system. With a
            strategic, remote-friendly resume and application process, you
            learned how to leverage inefficiencies in the job market to make
            yourself stand out. Once again, you put your value first, showcasing
            the results of your past roles, not just the responsibilities. You
            found opportunities to quickly and easily boost your knowledge and
            value-based skills. You optimized the design of your resume to
            easily jump through the hoops of the hiring process. You learned
            when to lie (and when not to lie) on your resume and how to use your
            network to open up opportunities that might not have been available
            to you before.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Ace the Interview
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>In Chapter Four, we reimagined the job interview, shifting
            from a Q&A mindset to an actual conversation. You learned how to
            prove you're a good culture fit, aligning yourself with the
            company's values and goals. You tested whether or not the company
            was a right fit—not just if you were the right fit. You imagined
            that the interviewer already liked you; you were just there to see
            if you liked them. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>You adapted this strategy to the nuances of
            remote interviews, giving yourself an edge over other candidates.
            You displayed confidence to prove competency because, let's face it,
            everyone's nervous. But your nerves don't have to dictate your
            success. And when you got the job, you aimed to negotiate more
            vacation days to make it easier to juggle your jobs and reach your
            overemployment goals.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>The First 90 Days
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Now, this is where it really all began. In Chapter Five, we
            laid a few ground rules for overemployment:
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Never tell anyone about what you’re doing. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Don’t onboard two jobs at the same time. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            • Treat the first ninety days like a sprint.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>The first ninety days are the key to establishing yourself in
            the company. Knowing this, you worked hard to understand the company
            culture and its goals. You did a good job and were aggressive about
            your goals. Most of all, you found a way to make yourself
            irreplaceable by finding a project you can take responsibility for:
            A project that no one else wanted to touch, existed outside your
            team, catered to your specific skills, or was classified as
            'business-critical.' <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>With this foundation, you got on track to
            become a project leader, not a project manager—someone who controls
            a project's schedule, meeting cadence, and flexibility. You marked
            your place and made friends in the workplace (so it's much harder
            for them to fire you). You established a routine and gauged
            expectations as you prepared to secretly cut down two-thirds of your
            schedule (while maintaining a hundred percent of your value). And,
            of course, you weren't afraid to quit if it wasn't the right fit.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>The Three-Hour-Workday
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>You got through the hardest part. Now, for the fun part:
            Working less. In Chapter Six, you learned to manage your workload
            effectively, turning forty hours of work into fifteen hours of
            results. How? In three steps:
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Step 1: Becoming aware of your core tasks: The tasks you can
            measure, isolate, and deliver to drive results.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Step 2: Weeding out your time-wasters and low-priority tasks:
            The tasks you have to do but no one's actually waiting on you to
            complete.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Step 3: Escaping the old loop: Don't pretend to be busy. Stop
            trying to multitask or task jump (remember, it doesn't work). Don't
            waste your time browsing online. Get the work done, and be done.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>To accomplish this, you identified your peak productivity
            hours and used time-blocking to focus on your core tasks. As you
            ramped up your pace, you learned to finish work quickly but not
            deliver it quickly. By establishing clear communication preferences
            and boundaries with coworkers, you gave yourself some leeway for
            missing any meetings or deadlines.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Outsource and Automate
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>In Chapter Seven, you took it up a notch, using outsourcing
            and automation to get as much work done in as little time as
            possible. You learned to automate or outsource repetitive or
            inefficient tasks, like communication, publishing, submittals,
            analytics, and data management and entry. You learned how to use
            code and no-code automations such as IFTTT, add-ons for apps,
            generative AI, and basic coding skills. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>If you needed to, you
            weren't afraid to hire an automation expert to help streamline
            processes or a virtual assistant to cut down your busy work. You
            began outsourcing "Start and Finish" tasks like initial research,
            idea boards, and quality assurance, speeding up the start and finish
            line of your work.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Learn to Juggle
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Now, for the payoff. This was the hardest (and most rewarding)
            part of the journey. In Chapter Eight, you got your first job (J1)
            down to about fifteen hours per week. From here, you began the
            search for your second job (J2), taking off time from your J1 to
            help with the transition. In this search, you followed eight key
            rules of overemployment:
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Rule #1: Avoid schedule conflicts at all costs.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Rule #2: Avoid working with competing companies.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Rule #3: Take advantage of the spill-over effect.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Rule #4: Meetings are enemy number one.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Rule #5: Be patient and give yourself time in the first ninety
            days.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Rule #6: Keep it on the down-low.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Rule #7: Don’t be afraid to walk away.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>The Golden Rule: Don’t cross-contaminate your jobs.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>To adhere to the golden rule, you established organization
            systems for your physical space, time, and mindset. You used
            separate technology, systems, and schedules for each job. You
            dedicated set timeframes to dive into one job at a time, allowing
            yourself to enter a flow state. You used simple mindset hacks to
            compartmentalize each job, stay productive, and get your work done.
            As you found your rhythm, you let yourself have good and bad days,
            avoiding burnout by taking breaks and prioritizing what matters
            most. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>By applying these strategies in our work, we can achieve
            better job security and more freedom to do what we love. Let us take
            inspiration from these practical methods and establish ourselves as
            efficient and productive workers, ready to overcome any challenges
            and achieve our goals. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Making it Happen
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>And now, you're here—you're ready to make Chapter Nine a
            reality. To plan your escape with strategy and success. And if you
            truly follow every step in this book, you can. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Now, if you
            skipped a few steps or didn't take action as you followed along,
            that's okay. Go back and do it now: <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Get the skills. Find the
            job. Sharpen your resume, and ace the interview. Take on the first
            ninety days strong. Establish yourself in the company. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>At the
            end of your sprint, find your pace. Find your core tasks, organize
            your workday, and focus your energy until you've whittled down
            "forty hours" of work and fluff into fifteen hours of hands-on
            results. <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>Work smarter. Automate and outsource the tasks that
            don't need your special touch. Once you've got it down, rinse and
            repeat: Find your second job, come in strong, and find your flow.
            With an intentional organization of your space, time, and mindset,
            nothing's stopping you.
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>
            <br /><span class="span-tab"></span>In the end? You can use your newfound time, financial, and
            professional freedom to live life your way. It's your life. Don't
            give it all away for a job. You run the show—and it's about to
            begin.

            <strong>Steven R. Thomas</strong> has spent the majority of his
            15-year career exploring how to best take advantage of corporate
            America's dismal employment systems to improve life for workers. By
            studying and experimenting with a multitude of different jobs and
            company sizes, he lays the groundwork for how to best take back your
            time, energy, and finances from the corporate systems - and with
            that time, shows you how to join the ranks of the “overemployed”.
