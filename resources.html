            https://www.instarem.com/blog/are-you-working-more-than-you-should/.
            <br />—— <br />The article notes on average, people spend over 13
            years of their lives working, and the correlation between employment
            and economic growth varies significantly among countries. OECD
            nations show differences in work hours, with Mexico having the
            longest workdays in 2021 and Germany the shortest.

            <br />—— <br />The article highlights companies like Kickstarter,
            Shopify, and Shake Shack that tested a four-day work week
            post-Covid-19. While historical norms settled on a 40-hour work
            week, economist Dan Hamermesh notes that the recent shift to shorter
            work weeks in firms is mainly confined to white-collar jobs and may
            not extend industry-wide.

            <br />—— <br />John Maynard Keynes foresaw a future where his
            grandchildren would work only 15 hours a week by age 15. Yet,
            insights from his own family members, such as retired professor
            Nicholas Humphrey and independent psychotherapist Susannah Burn,
            shed light on the workforce's realities. Although Keynes believed
            that innovation and technology would reduce working hours, the
            current pressure to stay competitive and boost income has made it
            challenging to embrace shorter workweeks.

            <br />—— <br />The article indicates that the Industrial Revolution
            gave rise to the eight-hour workday, which promoted fewer hours in
            order to improve the humaneness of the typical workplace. On the
            other hand, data indicates that the typical worker only produces for
            about three hours every day. From that perspective, a six-hour
            workday might improve concentration, sleep, and output.

            be a labor crisis. The industries with the most job opportunities

            <br />—— <br />A survey by ResumeBuilder.com revealed that 69% of US

            <br />—— <br />Working two remote jobs simultaneously is becoming
            more common, with 79% of employees working for multiple employers.
            This trend has inspired "Overemployed," a website aiming to help
            professionals achieve financial freedom. However, it may be
            ethically questionable, as employers may be concerned about
            employees working for multiple employers simultaneously.

            workforce. Due to a $3 billion negative cash flow scenario, Musk

            Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Meta have cut over 50,000 employees.
            These lay-offs can be attributed to the fact that tech leaders
            misjudged pandemic growth, with higher interest rates, inflation,

            <br />—— <br />Companies worldwide are implementing layoffs as
            cost-cutting measures amid a recession. Overhiring, often attributed
            to past practices, has led to underutilization of resources and
            increased costs. This is common in fields like engineering,
            technology, marketing, and banking. Startups may also be affected.

            that HR managers receive come from applicants who do not fit the job
            description. According to a different survey of employees, 78% of
            them would still apply for a job even if they did not meet all the
            requirements. On the other hand, according to 84% of HR managers,

            workday doing many other things besides work, including eating,
            socializing, or reading the news. Psychologists have found the brain
            can't focus on tasks for more than a few hours at a time. Some
            companies have started adjusting their schedules to help employees
            maximize their efficiency.

            prevalent issue among American workers due to remote work during the
            COVID-19 pandemic. Procrastination is motivated by emotional
            considerations including fear and fleeting pleasure. Managers should
            exercise self-forgiveness or provide greater rewards in order to
            counteract it.

            prefrontal cortex. The limbic system controls mood and pleasure,
            while the prefrontal cortex processes information. Training the
            brain to reduce procrastination can be beneficial.

            <br />—— <br />AI technologies such as ChatGPT are being used by an
            underground population of "overemployed" people to handle many
            full-time tasks at the same time. These employees use AI to write
            documents, produce reports, automate chores, and even draft cover
            letters for job applications. AI-driven tools have increased
            productivity and income, but concerns arise about employment future
            and labor market effects due to their potential to manage large
            workloads.

            <br />The 80-20 rule, also known as the Pareto Principle, states

            business, economics, and various fields like wealth distribution,
            personal finance, and relationships. The rule helps identify an

            overly smart brains. The process of converting letters into words
            and sentences is neglected in favor of generalization as the brain
            concentrates on the message that writing is intended to convey
            rather than the writing itself. Therefore, it's better to have
            someone else proofread your work to identify any errors.

            can enhance productivity and well-being, challenging the notion that

            can reduce fatigue, foster creativity, and enhance focus, all of
            which add up to more productive activities and meetings. Making rest
            a priority aids employees in maintaining their energy and
            concentration, which improves output because the brain's default
            network is still active throughout sleep, encouraging creativity and
